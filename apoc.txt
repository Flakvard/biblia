The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	1	And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord,and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the first month;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	2	Having set the priests according to their daily courses,being arrayed in long garments, in the temple of the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	3	And he spake unto the Levites, the holy ministers of Israel,that they should hallow themselves unto the Lord, to setthe holy ark of the Lord in the house that king Solomonthe son of David had built:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	4	And said, Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders:now therefore serve the Lord your God, and minister unto hispeople Israel, and prepare you after your families and kindreds,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	5	According as David the king of Israel prescribed,and according to the magnificence of Solomon his son:and standing in the temple according to the several dignityof the families of you the Levites, who minister in the presenceof your brethren the children of Israel,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	6	Offer the passover in order, and make ready the sacrificesfor your brethren, and keep the passover according to thecommandment of the Lord, which was given unto Moses.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	7	And unto the people that was found there Josias gavethirty thousand lambs and kids, and three thousand calves:these things were given of the king's allowance,according as he promised, to the people, to the priests,and to the Levites.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	8	And Helkias, Zacharias, and Syelus, the governors of the temple,gave to the priests for the passover two thousand and six hundred sheep,and three hundred calves.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	9	And Jeconias, and Samaias, and Nathanael his brother, and Assabias,and Ochiel, and Joram, captains over thousands, gave to the Levitesfor the passover five thousand sheep, and seven hundred calves.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	10	And when these things were done, the priests and Levites,having the unleavened bread, stood in very comely orderaccording to the kindreds,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	11	And according to the several dignities of the fathers,before the people, to offer to the Lord, as it is writtenin the book of Moses: and thus did they in the morning.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	12	And they roasted the passover with fire, as appertaineth:as for the sacrifices, they sod them in brass pots and panswith a good savour,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	13	And set them before all the people: and afterward they preparedfor themselves, and for the priests their brethren, the sons of Aaron.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	14	For the priests offered the fat until night: and the Levitesprepared for themselves, and the priests their brethren,the sons of Aaron.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	15	The holy singers also, the sons of Asaph, were in their order,according to the appointment of David, to wit, Asaph, Zacharias,and Jeduthun, who was of the king's retinue.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	16	Moreover the porters were at every gate; it was not lawfulfor any to go from his ordinary service: for their brethrenthe Levites prepared for them.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	17	Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrificesof the Lord accomplished in that day, that they mighthold  the passover,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	18	And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord,according to the commandment of king Josias.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	19	So the children of Israel which were present held thepassover at that time, and the feast of sweet bread seven days.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	20	And such a passover was not kept in Israel sincethe time of the prophet Samuel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	21	Yea, all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias,and the priests, and the Levites, and the Jews, held with all Israelthat were found dwelling at Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	22	In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	23	And the works or Josias were upright before his Lordwith an heart full of godliness.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	24	As for the things that came to pass in his time, they were writtenin former times, concerning those that sinned, and did wickedly againstthe Lord above all people and kingdoms, and how they grieved him exceedingly,so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	25	Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass,that Pharaoh the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamisupon Euphrates: and Josias went out against him.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	26	But the king of Egypt sent to him, saying,What have I to do with thee, O king of Judea?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	27	I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee; for my waris upon Euphrates: and now the Lord is with me, yea, the Lord iswith me hasting me forward: depart from me, and be not against the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	28	Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him,but undertook to fight with him, not regarding the wordsof the prophet Jeremy spoken by the mouth of the Lord:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	29	But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo,and the princes came against king Josias.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	30	Then said the king unto his servants, Carry me away out ofthe battle; for I am very weak. And immediately his servantstook him away out of the battle.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	31	Then gat he up upon his second chariot; and being broughtback to Jerusalem died, and was buried in his father's sepulchre.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	32	And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias, yea, Jeremy the prophetlamented for Josias, and the chief men with the women made lamentationfor him unto this day: and this was given out for an ordinanceto be done continually in all the nation of Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	33	These things are written in the book of the stories of thekings of Judah, and every one of the acts that Josias did,and his glory, and his understanding in the law of the Lord,and the things that he had done before, and the things now recited,are reported in the book of the kings of Israel and Judea.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	34	And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias, and made him kinginstead of Josias his father, when he was twenty and three years old.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	35	And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months: andthen the king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	36	And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talentsof silver and one talent of gold.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	37	The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother kingof Judea and Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	38	And he bound Joacim and the nobles: but Zaraces his brotherhe apprehended, and brought him out of Egypt.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	39	Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the landof Judea and Jerusalem; and he did evil before the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	40	Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up,and bound him with a chain of brass, and carried him into Babylon.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	41	Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord,and carried them away, and set them in his own temple at Babylon.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	42	But those things that are recorded of him, and of his uncleaness and impiety,are written in the chronicles of the kings.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	43	And Joacim his son reigned in his stead:he was made king being eighteen years old;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	44	And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem;and did evil before the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	45	So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to bebrought into Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	46	And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem, when he wasone and twenty years old; and he reigned eleven years:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	47	And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord, and cared notfor the words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremyfrom the mouth of the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	48	And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swearby the name of the Lord, he forswore himself, and rebelled;and hardening his neck, his heart, he transgressed the lawsof the Lord God of Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	49	The governors also of the people and of the priests did many thingsagainst the laws, and passed all the pollutions of all nations,and defiled the temple of the Lord, which was sanctified in Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	50	Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messengerto call them back, because he spared them and his tabernacle also.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	51	But they had his messengers in derision; and, look, when theLord spake unto them, they made a sport of his prophets:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	52	So far forth, that he, being wroth with his people for their great ungodliness,commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against them;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	53	Who slew their young men with the sword, yea, even within the compassof their holy temple, and spared neither young man nor maid,old man nor child, among them; for he delivered all into their hands.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	54	And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord,both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God,and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	55	As for the house of the Lord, they burnt it, and brake downthe walls of Jerusalem, and set fire upon her towers:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	56	And as for her glorious things, they never ceased till theyhad consumed and brought them all to nought: and the peoplethat were not slain with the sword he carried unto Babylon:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	57	Who became servants to him and his children, till the Persians reigned,to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	1	58	Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths, the whole time of herdesolation shall she rest, until the full term of seventy years.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	1	In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians, that theword of the Lord might be accomplished, that he had promised bythe mouth of Jeremy;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	2	The Lord raised up the spirit of Cyrus the king of thePersians, and he made proclamation through all his kingdom, andalso by writing,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	3	Saying, Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians; The Lord ofIsrael, the most high Lord, hath made me king of the wholeworld,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	4	And commanded me to build him an house at Jerusalem in Jewry.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	5	If therefore there be any of you that are of his people, letthe Lord, even his Lord, be with him, and let him go up toJerusalem that is in Judea, and build the house of the Lord ofIsrael: for he is the Lord that dwelleth in Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	6	Whosoever then dwell in the places about, let them help him,those, I say, that are his neighbours, with gold, and withsilver,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	7	With gifts, with horses, and with cattle, and other things,which have been set forth by vow, for the temple of the Lord atJerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	8	Then the chief of the families of Judea and of the tribe ofBenjamin stood up; the priests also, and the Levites, and allthey whose mind the Lord had moved to go up, and to build anhouse for the Lord at Jerusalem,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	9	And they that dwelt round about them, and helped them in allthings with silver and gold, with horses and cattle, and withvery many free gifts of a great number whose minds were stirredup thereto.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	10	King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels, whichNabuchodonosor had carried away from Jerusalem, and had set upin his temple of idols.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	11	Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth,he delivered them to Mithridates his treasurer:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	12	And by him they were delivered to Sanabassar the governor ofJudea.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	13	And this was the number of them; A thousand golden cups, anda thousand of silver, censers of silver twenty nine, vials ofgold thirty, and of silver two thousand four hundred and ten,and a thousand other vessels.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	14	So all the vessels of gold and of silver, which were carriedaway, were five thousand four hundred threescore and nine.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	15	These were brought back by Sanabassar, together with them ofthe captivity, from Babylon to Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	16	But in the time of Artexerxes king of the Persians Belemus,and Mithridates, and Tabellius, and Rathumus, and Beeltethmus,and Semellius the secretary, with others that were in commissionwith them, dwelling in Samaria and other places, wrote unto himagainst them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem these lettersfollowing;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	17	To king Artexerxes our lord, Thy servants, Rathumus thestorywriter, and Semellius the scribe, and the rest of theircouncil, and the judges that are in Celosyria and Phenice.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	18	Be it now known to the lord king, that the Jews that are upfrom you to us, being come into Jerusalem, that rebellious andwicked city, do build the marketplaces, and repair the walls ofit and do lay the foundation of the temple.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	19	Now if this city and the walls thereof be made up again, theywill not only refuse to give tribute, but also rebel againstkings.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	20	And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are nowin hand, we think it meet not to neglect such a matter,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	21	But to speak unto our lord the king, to the intent that, ifit be thy pleasure it may be sought out in the books of thyfathers:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	22	And thou shalt find in the chronicles what is writtenconcerning these things, and shalt understand that that city wasrebellious, troubling both kings and cities:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	23	And that the Jews were rebellious, and raised always warstherein; for the which cause even this city was made desolate.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	24	Wherefore now we do declare unto thee, O lord the king, thatif this city be built again, and the walls thereof set up anew,thou shalt from henceforth have no passage into Celosyria andPhenice.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	25	Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the storywriter,to Beeltethmus, to Semellius the scribe, and to the rest thatwere in commission, and dwellers in Samaria and Syria andPhenice, after this manner;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	26	I have read the epistle which ye have sent unto me: thereforeI commanded to make diligent search, and it hath been found thatthat city was from the beginning practising against kings;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	27	And the men therein were given to rebellion and war: and thatmighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem, who reigned andexacted tributes in Celosyria and Phenice.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	28	Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men frombuilding the city, and heed to be taken that there be no moredone in it;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	29	And that those wicked workers proceed no further to theannoyance of kings,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	2	30	Then king Artexerxes his letters being read, Rathumus, andSemellius the scribe, and the rest that were in commission withthem, removing in haste toward Jerusalem with a troop ofhorsemen and a multitude of people in battle array, began tohinder the builders; and the building of the temple in Jerusalemceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of thePersians.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	1	Now when Darius reigned, he made a great feast unto all hissubjects, and unto all his household, and unto all the princesof Media and Persia,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	2	And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants thatwere under him, from India unto Ethiopia, of an hundred twentyand seven provinces.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	3	And when they had eaten and drunken, and being satisfied weregone home, then Darius the king went into his bedchamber, andslept, and soon after awaked.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	4	Then three young men, that were of the guard that kept theking's body, spake one to another;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	5	Let every one of us speak a sentence: he that shall overcome,and whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others, unto himshall the king Darius give great gifts, and great things intoken of victory:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	6	As, to be clothed in purple, to drink in gold, and to sleepupon gold, and a chariot with bridles of gold, and an headtireof fine linen, and a chain about his neck:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	7	And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom, andshall be called Darius his cousin.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	8	And then every one wrote his sentence, sealed it, and laid itunder king Darius his pillow;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	9	And said that, when the king is risen, some will give him thewritings; and of whose side the king and the three princes ofPersia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest, to him shallthe victory be given, as was appointed.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	10	The first wrote, Wine is the strongest.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	11	The second wrote, The king is strongest.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	12	The third wrote, Women are strongest: but above all thingsTruth beareth away the victory.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	13	Now when the king was risen up, they took their writings, anddelivered them unto him, and so he read them:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	14	And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia andMedia, and the governors, and the captains, and the lieutenants,and the chief officers;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	15	And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment; and thewritings were read before them.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	16	And he said, Call the young men, and they shall declare theirown sentences. So they were called, and came in.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	17	And he said unto them, Declare unto us your mind concerningthe writings. Then began the first, who had spoken of thestrength of wine;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	18	And he said thus, O ye men, how exceeding strong is wine! itcauseth all men to err that drink it:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	19	It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child tobe all one; of the bondman and of the freeman, of the poor manand of the rich:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	20	It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth, so thata man remembereth neither sorrow nor debt:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	21	And it maketh every heart rich, so that a man rememberethneither king nor governor; and it maketh to speak all things bytalents:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	22	And when they are in their cups, they forget their love bothto friends and brethren, and a little after draw out swords:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	23	But when they are from the wine, they remember not what theyhave done.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	3	24	O ye men, is not wine the strongest, that enforceth to dothus? And when he had so spoken, he held his peace.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	1	Then the second, that had spoken of the strength of the king,began to say,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	2	O ye men, do not men excel in strength that bear rule oversea and land and all things in them?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	3	But yet the king is more mighty: for he is lord of all thesethings, and hath dominion over them; and whatsoever hecommandeth them they do.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	4	If he bid them make war the one against the other, they doit: if he send them out against the enemies, they go, and breakdown mountains walls and towers.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	5	They slay and are slain, and transgress not the king'scommandment: if they get the victory, they bring all to theking, as well the spoil, as all things else.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	6	Likewise for those that are no soldiers, and have not to dowith wars, but use husbundry, when they have reaped again thatwhich they had sown, they bring it to the king, and compel oneanother to pay tribute unto the king.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	7	And yet he is but one man: if he command to kill, they kill;if he command to spare, they spare;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	8	If he command to smite, they smite; if he command to makedesolate, they make desolate; if he command to build, theybuild;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	9	If he command to cut down, they cut down; if he command toplant, they plant.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	10	So all his people and his armies obey him: furthermore helieth down, he eateth and drinketh, and taketh his rest:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	11	And these keep watch round about him, neither may any onedepart, and do his own business, neither disobey they him in anything.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	12	O ye men, how should not the king be mightiest, when in suchsort he is obeyed? And he held his tongue.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	13	Then the third, who had spoken of women, and of the truth,(this was Zorobabel) began to speak.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	14	O ye men, it is not the great king, nor the multitude of men,neither is it wine, that excelleth; who is it then that ruleththem, or hath the lordship over them? are they not women?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	15	Women have borne the king and all the people that bear ruleby sea and land.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	16	Even of them came they: and they nourished them up thatplanted the vineyards, from whence the wine cometh.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	17	These also make garments for men; these bring glory unto men;and without women cannot men be.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	18	Yea, and if men have gathered together gold and silver, orany other goodly thing, do they not love a woman which is comelyin favour and beauty?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	19	And letting all those things go, do they not gape, and evenwith open mouth fix their eyes fast on her; and have not all menmore desire unto her than unto silver or gold, or any goodlything whatsoever?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	20	A man leaveth his own father that brought him up, and his owncountry, and cleaveth unto his wife.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	21	He sticketh not to spend his life with his wife. andremembereth neither father, nor mother, nor country.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	22	By this also ye must know that women have dominion over you:do ye not labour and toil, and give and bring all to the woman?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	23	Yea, a man taketh his sword, and goeth his way to rob and tosteal, to sail upon the sea and upon rivers;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	24	And looketh upon a lion, and goeth in the darkness; and whenhe hath stolen, spoiled, and robbed, he bringeth it to his love.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	25	Wherefore a man loveth his wife better than father or mother.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	26	Yea, many there be that have run out of their wits for women,and become servants for their sakes.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	27	Many also have perished, have erred, and sinned, for women.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	28	And now do ye not believe me? is not the king great in hispower? do not all regions fear to touch him?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	29	Yet did I see him and Apame the king's concubine, thedaughter of the admirable Bartacus, sitting at the right hand ofthe king,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	30	And taking the crown from the king's head, and setting itupon her own head; she also struck the king with her left hand.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	31	And yet for all this the king gaped and gazed upon her withopen mouth: if she laughed upon him, he laughed also: but if shetook any displeasure at him, the king was fain to flatter, thatshe might be reconciled to him again.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	32	O ye men, how can it be but women should be strong, seeingthey do thus?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	33	Then the king and the princes looked one upon another: so hebegan to speak of the truth.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	34	O ye men, are not women strong? great is the earth, high isthe heaven, swift is the sun in his course, for he compasseththe heavens round about, and fetcheth his course again to hisown place in one day.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	35	Is he not great that maketh these things? therefore great isthe truth, and stronger than all things.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	36	All the earth crieth upon the truth, and the heaven blessethit: all works shake and tremble at it, and with it is nounrighteous thing.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	37	Wine is wicked, the king is wicked, women are wicked, all thechildren of men are wicked, and such are all their wicked works;and there is no truth in them; in their unrighteousness alsothey shall perish.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	38	As for the truth, it endureth, and is alwaYs strong; itliveth and conquereth for evermore.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	39	With her there is no accepting of persons or rewards; but shedoeth the things that are just, and refraineth from all unjustand wicked things; and all men do well like of her works.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	40	Neither in her judgment is any unrighteousness; and she isthe strength, kingdom, power, and majesty, of all ages. Blessedbe the God of truth.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	41	And with that he held his peace. And all the people thenshouted, and said, Great is Truth, and mighty above all things.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	42	Then said the king unto him, Ask what thou wilt more than isappointed in the writing, and we will give it thee, because thouart found wisest; and thou shalt sit next me, and shalt becalled my cousin.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	43	Then said he unto the king, Remember thy vow, which thou hastvowed to build Jerusalem, in the day when thou camest to thykingdom,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	44	And to send away all the vessels that were taken away out ofJerusalem, which Cyrus set apart, when he vowed to destroyBabylon, and to send them again thither.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	45	Thou also hast vowed to build up the temple, which theEdomites burned when Judea was made desolate by the Chaldees.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	46	And now, O lord the king, this is that which I require, andwhich I desire of thee, and this is the princely liberalityproceeding from thyself: I desire therefore that thou make goodthe vow, the performance whereof with thine own mouth thou hastvowed to the King of heaven.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	47	Then Darius the king stood up, and kissed him, and wroteletters for him unto all the treasurers and lieutenants andcaptains and governors, that they should safely convey on theirway both him, and all those that go up with him to buildJerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	48	He wrote letters also unto the lieutenants that were inCelosyria and Phenice, and unto them in Libanus, that theyshould bring cedar wood from Libanus unto Jerusalem, and thatthey should build the city with him.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	4	49	Moreover he wrote for all the Jews that went out of his realmup into Jewry, concerning their freedom, that no officer, noruler, no lieutenant, nor treasurer, should forcibly enter intotheir doors;

The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	47	But when the seventh month was at hand, and when the childrenof Israel were every man in his own place, they came alltogether with one consent into the open place of the first gatewhich is toward the east.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	48	Then stood up Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren thepriests and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren,and made ready the altar of the God of Israel,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	49	To offer burnt sacrifices upon it, according as it isexpressly commanded in the book of Moses the man of God.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	50	And there were gathered unto them out of the other nations ofthe land, and they erected the altar upon his own place, becauseall the nations of the land were at enmity with them, andoppressed them; and they offered sacrifices according to thetime, and burnt offerings to the Lord both morning and evening.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	51	Also they held the feast of tabernacles, as it is commandedin the law, and offered sacrifices daily, as was meet:

The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	55	Unto them of Zidon also and Tyre they gave carrs, that theyshould bring cedar trees from Libanus, which should be broughtby floats to the haven of Joppa, according as it was commandedthem by Cyrus king of the Persians.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	56	And in the second year and second month after his coming tothe temple of God at Jerusalem began Zorobabel the son ofSalathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec, and their brethren, andthe priests, and the Levites, and all they that were come untoJerusalem out of the captivity:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	57	And they laid the foundation of the house of God in the firstday of the second month, in the second year after they were cometo Jewry and Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	58	And they appointed the Levites from twenty years old over theworks of the Lord. Then stood up Jesus, and his sons andbrethren, and Cadmiel his brother, and the sons of Madiabun,with the sons of Joda the son of Eliadun, with their sons andbrethren, all Levites, with one accord setters forward of thebusiness, labouring to advance the works in the house of God. Sothe workmen built the temple of the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	59	And the priests stood arrayed in their vestments with musicalinstruments and trumpets; and the Levites the sons of Asaph hadcymbals,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	60	Singing songs of thanksgiving, and praising the Lord,according as David the king of Israel had ordained.

The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	62	And all the people sounded trumpets, and shouted with a loudvoice, singing songs of thanksgiving unto the Lord for therearing up of the house of the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	63	Also of the priests and Levites, and of the chief of theirfamilies, the ancients who had seen the former house came to thebuilding of this with weeping and great crying.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	64	But many with trumpets and joy shouted with loud voice,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	65	Insomuch that the trumpets might not be heard for the weepingof the people: yet the multitude sounded marvellously, so thatit was heard afar off.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	66	Wherefore when the enemies of the tribe of Judah and Benjaminheard it, they came to know what that noise of trumpets shouldmean.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	67	And they perceived that they that were of the captivity didbuild the temple unto the Lord God of Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	68	So they went to Zorobabel and Jesus, and to the chief of thefamilies, and said unto them, We will build together with you.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	69	For we likewise, as ye, do obey your Lord, and do sacrificeunto him from the days of Azbazareth the king of the Assyrians,who brought us hither.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	70	Then Zorobabel and Jesus and the chief of the families ofIsrael said unto them, It is not for us and you to buildtogether an house unto the Lord our God.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	71	We ourselves alone will build unto the Lord of Israel,according as Cyrus the king of the Persians hath commanded us.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	72	But the heathen of the land lying heavy upon the inhabitantsof Judea, and holding them strait, hindered their building;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	5	73	And by their secret plots, and popular persuasions andcommotions, they hindered the finishing of the building all thetime that king Cyrus lived: so they were hindered from buildingfor the space of two years, until the reign of Darius.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	1	Now in the second year of the reign of Darius Aggeus andZacharias the son of Addo, the prophets, prophesied unto theJews in Jewry and Jerusalem in the name of the Lord God ofIsrael, which was upon them.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	2	Then stood up Zorobabel the son of Salatiel, and Jesus theson of Josedec, and began to build the house of the Lord atJerusalem, the prophets of the Lord being with them, and helpingthem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	3	At the same time came unto them Sisinnes the governor ofSyria and Phenice, with Sathrabuzanes and his companions, andsaid unto them,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	4	By whose appointment do ye build this house and this roof,and perform all the other things? and who are the workmen thatperform these things?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	5	Nevertheless the elders of the Jews obtained favour, becausethe Lord had visited the captivity;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	6	And they were not hindered from building, until such time assignification was given unto Darius concerning them, and ananswer received.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	7	The copy of the letters which Sisinnes, governor of Syria andPhenice, and Sathrabuzanes, with their companions, rulers inSyria and Phenice, wrote and sent unto Darius; To king Darius,greeting:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	8	Let all things be known unto our lord the king, that beingcome into the country of Judea, and entered into the city ofJerusalem we found in the city of Jerusalem the ancients of theJews that were of the captivity
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	9	Building an house unto the Lord, great and new, of hewn andcostly stones, and the timber already laid upon the walls.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	10	And those works are done with great speed, and the work goethon prosperously in their hands, and with all glory and diligenceis it made.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	11	Then asked we these elders, saying, By whose commandmentbuild ye this house, and lay the foundations of these works?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	12	Therefore to the intent that we might give knowledge untothee by writing, we demanded of them who were the chief doers,and we required of them the names in writing of their principalmen.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	13	So they gave us this answer, We are the servants of the Lordwhich made heaven and earth.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	14	And as for this house, it was builded many years ago by aking of Israel great and strong, and was finished.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	15	But when our fathers provoked God unto wrath, and sinnedagainst the Lord of Israel which is in heaven, he gave them overinto the power of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, of theChaldees;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	16	Who pulled down the house, and burned it, and carried awaythe people captives unto Babylon.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	17	But in the first year that king Cyrus reigned over thecountry of Babylon Cyrus the king wrote to build up this house.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	18	And the holy vessels of gold and of silver, thatNabuchodonosor had carried away out of the house at Jerusalem,and had set them in his own temple those Cyrus the king broughtforth again out of the temple at Babylon, and they weredelivered to Zorobabel and to Sanabassarus the ruler,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	19	With commandment that he should carry away the same vessels,and put them in the temple at Jerusalem; and that the temple ofthe Lord should be built in his place.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	20	Then the same Sanabassarus, being come hither, laid thefoundations of the house of the Lord at Jerusalem; and from thattime to this being still a building, it is not yet fully ended.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	21	Now therefore, if it seem good unto the king, let search bemade among the records of king Cyrus:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	22	And if it be found that the building of the house of the Lordat Jerusalem hath been done with the consent of king Cyrus, andif our lord the king be so minded, let him signify unto usthereof.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	23	Then commanded king Darius to seek among the records atBabylon: and so at Ecbatane the palace, which is in the countryof Media, there was found a roll wherein these things wererecorded.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	24	In the first year of the reign of Cyrus king Cyrus commandedthat the house of the Lord at Jerusalem should be built again,where they do sacrifice with continual fire:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	25	Whose height shall be sixty cubits and the breadth sixtycubits, with three rows of hewn stones, and one row of new woodof that country; and the expences thereof to be given out of thehouse of king Cyrus:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	26	And that the holy vessels of the house of the Lord, both ofgold and silver, that Nabuchodonosor took out of the house atJerusalem, and brought to Babylon, should be restored to thehouse at Jerusalem, and be set in the place where they werebefore.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	27	And also he commanded that Sisinnes the governor of Syria andPhenice, and Sathrabuzanes, and their companions, and thosewhich were appointed rulers in Syria and Phenice, should becareful not to meddle with the place, but suffer Zorobabel, theservant of the Lord, and governor of Judea, and the elders ofthe Jews, to build the house of the Lord in that place.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	28	I have commanded also to have it built up whole again; andthat they look diligently to help those that be of the captivityof the Jews, till the house of the Lord be finished:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	29	And out of the tribute of Celosyria and Phenice a portioncarefully to be given these men for the sacrifices of the Lord,that is, to Zorobabel the governor, for bullocks, and rams, andlambs;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	30	And also corn, salt, wine, and oil, and that continuallyevery year without further question, according as the prieststhat be in Jerusalem shall signify to be daily spent:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	31	That offerings may be made to the most high God for the kingand for his children, and that they may pray for their lives.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	32	And he commanded that whosoever should transgress, yea, ormake light of any thing afore spoken or written, out of his ownhouse should a tree be taken, and he thereon be hanged, and allhis goods seized for the king.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	33	The Lord therefore, whose name is there called upon, utterlydestroy every king and nation, that stretcheth out his hand tohinder or endamage that house of the Lord in Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	6	34	I Darius the king have ordained that according unto thesethings it be done with diligence.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	1	Then Sisinnes the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, andSathrabuzanes, with their companions following the commandmentsof king Darius,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	2	Did very carefully oversee the holy works, assisting theancients of the Jews and governors of the temple.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	3	And so the holy works prospered, when Aggeus and Zachariasthe prophets prophesied.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	4	And they finished these things by the commandment of the LordGod of Israel, and with the consent of Cyrus, Darius, andArtexerxes, kings of Persia.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	5	And thus was the holy house finished in the three andtwentieth day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of Dariusking of the Persians
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	6	And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, andothers that were of the captivity, that were added unto them,did according to the things written in the book of Moses.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	7	And to the dedication of the temple of the Lord they offeredan hundred bullocks two hundred rams, four hundred lambs;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	8	And twelve goats for the sin of all Israel, according to thenumber of the chief of the tribes of Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	9	The priests also and the Levites stood arrayed in theirvestments, according to their kindreds, in the service of theLord God of Israel, according to the book of Moses: and theporters at every gate.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	10	And the children of Israel that were of the captivity heldthe passover the fourteenth day of the first month, after thatthe priests and the Levites were sanctified.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	11	They that were of the captivity were not all sanctifiedtogether: but the Levites were all sanctified together.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	12	And so they offered the passover for all them of thecaptivity, and for their brethren the priests, and forthemselves.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	13	And the children of Israel that came out of the captivity dideat, even all they that had separated themselves from theabominations of the people of the land, and sought the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	14	And they kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days,making merry before the Lord,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	7	15	For that he had turned the counsel of the king of Assyriatoward them, to strengthen their hands in the works of the LordGod of Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	1	And after these things, when Artexerxes the king of thePersians reigned came Esdras the son of Saraias, the son ofEzerias, the son of Helchiah, the son of Salum,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	2	The son of Sadduc, the son of Achitob, the son of Amarias,the son of Ezias, the son of Meremoth, the son of Zaraias, theson of Savias, the son of Boccas, the son of Abisum, the son ofPhinees, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the chief priest.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	3	This Esdras went up from Babylon, as a scribe, being veryready in the law of Moses, that was given by the God of Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	4	And the king did him honour: for he found grace in his sightin all his requests.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	5	There went up with him also certain of the children ofIsrael, of the priest of the Levites, of the holy singers,porters, and ministers of the temple, unto Jerusalem,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	6	In the seventh year of the reign of Artexerxes, in the fifthmonth, this was the king's seventh year; for they went fromBabylon in the first day of the first month, and came toJerusalem, according to the prosperous journey which the Lordgave them.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	7	For Esdras had very great skill, so that he omitted nothingof the law and commandments of the Lord, but taught all Israelthe ordinances and judgments.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	8	Now the copy of the commission, which was written fromArtexerxes the king, and came to Esdras the priest and reader ofthe law of the Lord, is this that followeth;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	9	King Artexerxes unto Esdras the priest and reader of the lawof the Lord sendeth greeting:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	10	Having determined to deal graciously, I have given order,that such of the nation of the Jews, and of the priests andLevites being within our realm, as are willing and desirousshould go with thee unto Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	11	As many therefore as have a mind thereunto, let them departwith thee, as it hath seemed good both to me and my sevenfriends the counsellors;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	12	That they may look unto the affairs of Judea and Jerusalem,agreeably to that which is in the law of the Lord;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	13	And carry the gifts unto the Lord of Israel to Jerusalem,which I and my friends have vowed, and all the gold and silverthat in the country of Babylon can be found, to the Lord inJerusalem,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	14	With that also which is given of the people for the temple ofthe Lord their God at Jerusalem: and that silver and gold may becollected for bullocks, rams, and lambs, and things thereuntoappertaining;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	15	To the end that they may offer sacrifices unto the Lord uponthe altar of the Lord their God, which is in Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	16	And whatsoever thou and thy brethren will do with the silverand gold, that do, according to the will of thy God.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	17	And the holy vessels of the Lord, which are given thee forthe use of the temple of thy God, which is in Jerusalem, thoushalt set before thy God in Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	18	And whatsoever thing else thou shalt remember for the use ofthe temple of thy God, thou shalt give it out of the king'streasury.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	19	And I king Artexerxes have also commanded the keepers of thetreasures in Syria and Phenice, that whatsoever Esdras thepriest and the reader of the law of the most high God shall sendfor, they should give it him with speed,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	20	To the sum of an hundred talents of silver, likewise also ofwheat even to an hundred cors, and an hundred pieces of wine,and other things in abundance.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	21	Let all things be performed after the law of God diligentlyunto the most high God, that wrath come not upon the kingdom ofthe king and his sons.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	22	I command you also, that ye require no tax, nor any otherimposition, of any of the priests, or Levites, or holy singers,or porters, or ministers of the temple, or of any that havedoings in this temple, and that no man have authority to imposeany thing upon them.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	23	And thou, Esdras, according to the wisdom of God ordainjudges and justices, that they may judge in all Syria andPhenice all those that know the law of thy God; and those thatknow it not thou shalt teach.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	24	And whosoever shall transgress the law of thy God, and of theking, shall be punished diligently, whether it be by death, orother punishment, by penalty of money, or by imprisonment.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	25	Then said Esdras the scribe, Blessed be the only Lord God ofmy fathers, who hath put these things into the heart of theking, to glorify his house that is in Jerusalem:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	26	And hath honoured me in the sight of the king, and hiscounsellors, and all his friends and nobles.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	27	Therefore was I encouraged by the help of the Lord my God,and gathered together men of Israel to go up with me.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	28	And these are the chief according to their families and severaldignities, that went up with me from Babylon in the reign ofking Artexerxes:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	29	Of the sons of Phinees, Gerson: of the sons of Ithamar,Gamael: of the sons of David, Lettus the son of Sechenias:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	30	Of the sons of Pharez, Zacharias; and with him were countedan hundred and fifty men:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	31	Of the sons of Pahath Moab, Eliaonias, the son of Zaraias,and with him two hundred men:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	32	Of the sons of Zathoe, Sechenias the son of Jezelus, and withhim three hundred men: of the sons of Adin, Obeth the son ofJonathan, and with him two hundred and fifty men:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	33	Of the sons of Elam, Josias son of Gotholias, and with himseventy men:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	34	Of the sons of Saphatias, Zaraias son of Michael, and withhim threescore and ten men:

The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	38	Of the sons of Astath, Johannes son of Acatan, and with himan hundred and ten men:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	39	Of the sons of Adonikam the last, and these are the names ofthem, Eliphalet, Jewel, and Samaias, and with them seventy men:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	40	Of the sons of Bago, Uthi the son of Istalcurus, and with himseventy men.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	41	And these I gathered together to the river called Theras,where we pitched our tents three days: and then I surveyed them.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	42	But when I had found there none of the priests and Levites,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	43	Then sent I unto Eleazar, and Iduel, and Masman,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	44	And Alnathan, and Mamaias, and Joribas, and Nathan, Eunatan,Zacharias, and Mosollamon, principal men and learned.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	45	And I bade them that they should go unto Saddeus the captain,who was in the place of the treasury:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	46	And commanded them that they should speak unto Daddeus, andto his brethren, and to the treasurers in that place, to send ussuch men as might execute the priests' office in the house ofthe Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	47	And by the mighty hand of our Lord they brought unto usskilful men of the sons of Moli the son of Levi, the son ofIsrael, Asebebia, and his sons, and his brethren, who wereeighteen.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	48	And Asebia, and Annus, and Osaias his brother, of the sonsof Channuneus, and their sons, were twenty men.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	49	And of the servants of the temple whom David had ordained,and the principal men for the service of the Levites to wit, theservants of the temple two hundred and twenty, the catalogue ofwhose names were shewed.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	50	And there I vowed a fast unto the young men before our Lord,to desire of him a prosperous journey both for us and them thatwere with us, for our children, and for the cattle:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	51	For I was ashamed to ask the king footmen, and horsemen, andconduct for safeguard against our adversaries.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	52	For we had said unto the king, that the power of the Lord ourGod should be with them that seek him, to support them in allways.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	53	And again we besought our Lord as touching these things, andfound him favourable unto us.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	54	Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,Esebrias, and Assanias, and ten men of their brethren with them:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	55	And I weighed them the gold, and the silver, and the holyvessels of the house of our Lord, which the king, and hiscouncil, and the princes, and all Israel, had given.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	56	And when I had weighed it, I delivered unto them six hundredand fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels of an hundredtalents, and an hundred talents of gold,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	57	And twenty golden vessels, and twelve vessels of brass, evenof fine brass, glittering like gold.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	58	And I said unto them, Both ye are holy unto the Lord, and thevessels are holy, and the gold and the silver is a vow unto theLord, the Lord of our fathers.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	59	Watch ye, and keep them till ye deliver them to the chief ofthe priests and Levites, and to the principal men of thefamilies of Israel, in Jerusalem, into the chambers of the houseof our God.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	60	So the priests and the Levites, who had received the silverand the gold and the vessels, brought them unto Jerusalem, intothe temple of the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	61	And from the river Theras we departed the twelfth day of thefirst month, and came to Jerusalem by the mighty hand of ourLord, which was with us: and from the beginning of our journeythe Lord delivered us from every enemy, and so we came toJerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	62	And when we had been there three days, the gold and silverthat was weighed was delivered in the house of our Lord on thefourth day unto Marmoth the priest the son of Iri.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	63	And with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with themwere Josabad the son of Jesu and Moeth the son of Sabban,Levites: all was delivered them by number and weight.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	64	And all the weight of them was written up the same hour.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	65	Moreover they that were come out of the captivity offeredsacrifice unto the Lord God of Israel, even twelve bullocks forall Israel, fourscore and sixteen rams,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	66	Threescore and twelve lambs, goats for a peace offering,twelve; all of them a sacrifice to the Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	67	And they delivered the king's commandments unto the king'sstewards' and to the governors of Celosyria and Phenice; andthey honoured the people and the temple of God.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	68	Now when these things were done, the rulers came unto me, andsaid,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	69	The nation of Israel, the princes, the priests and Levites,have not put away from them the strange people of the land, northe pollutions of the Gentiles to wit, of the Canaanites,Hittites, Pheresites, Jebusites, and the Moabites, Egyptians,and Edomites.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	70	For both they and their sons have married with theirdaughters, and the holy seed is mixed with the strange people ofthe land; and from the beginning of this matter the rulers andthe great men have been partakers of this iniquity.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	71	And as soon as I had heard these things, I rent my clothes,and the holy garment, and pulled off the hair from off my headand beard, and sat me down sad and very heavy.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	72	So all they that were then moved at the word of the Lord Godof Israel assembled unto me, whilst I mourned for the iniquity:but I sat still full of heaviness until the evening sacrifice.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	73	Then rising up from the fast with my clothes and the holygarment rent, and bowing my knees, and stretching forth my handsunto the Lord,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	74	I said, O Lord, I am confounded and ashamed before thy face;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	75	For our sins are multiplied above our heads, and ourignorances have reached up unto heaven.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	76	For ever since the time of our fathers we have been and arein great sin, even unto this day.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	77	And for our sins and our fathers' we with our brethren andour kings and our priests were given up unto the kings of theearth, to the sword, and to captivity, and for a prey withshame, unto this day.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	78	And now in some measure hath mercy been shewed unto us fromthee, O Lord, that there should be left us a root and a name inthe place of thy sanctuary;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	79	And to discover unto us a light in the house of the Lord ourGod, and to give us food in the time of our servitude.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	80	Yea, when we were in bondage, we were not forsaken of ourLord; but he made us gracious before the kings of Persia, sothat they gave us food;
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	81	Yea, and honoured the temple of our Lord, and raised up thedesolate Sion, that they have given us a sure abiding in Jewryand Jerusalem.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	82	And now, O Lord, what shall we say, having these things? forwe have transgressed thy commandments, which thou gavest by thehand of thy servants the prophets, saying,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	83	That the land, which ye enter into to possess as an heritage,is a land polluted with the pollutions of the strangers of theland, and they have filled it with their uncleanness.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	84	Therefore now shall ye not join your daughters unto theirsons, neither shall ye take their daughters unto your sons.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	85	Moreover ye shall never seek to have peace with them, that yemay be strong, and eat the good things of the land, and that yemay leave the inheritance of the land unto your children forevermore.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	86	And all that is befallen is done unto us for our wicked worksand great sins; for thou, O Lord, didst make our sins light,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	87	And didst give unto us such a root: but we have turned backagain to transgress thy law, and to mingle ourselves with theuncleanness of the nations of the land.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	88	Mightest not thou be angry with us to destroy us, till thouhadst left us neither root, seed, nor name?
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	89	O Lord of Israel, thou art true: for we are left a root thisday.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	90	Behold, now are we before thee in our iniquities, for wecannot stand any longer by reason of these things before thee.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	91	And as Esdras in his prayer made his confession, weeping, andlying flat upon the ground before the temple, there gatheredunto him from Jerusalem a very great multitude of men and womenand children: for there was great weeping among the multitude.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	92	Then Jechonias the son of Jeelus, one of the sons of Israel,called out, and said, O Esdras, we have sinned against the LordGod, we have married strange women of the nations of the land,and now is all Israel aloft.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	93	Let us make an oath to the Lord, that we will put away allour wives, which we have taken of the heathen, with theirchildren,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	94	Like as thou hast decreed, and as many as do obey the law ofthe Lord.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	95	Arise and put in execution: for to thee doth this matterappertain, and we will be with thee: do valiantly.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	8	96	So Esdras arose, and took an oath of the chief of the priestsand Levites of all Israel to do after these things; and so theysware.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	1	Then Esdras rising from the court of the temple went to thechamber of Joanan the son of Eliasib,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	2	And remained there, and did eat no meat nor drink water,mourning for the great iniquities of the multitude.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	3	And there was a proclamation in all Jewry and Jerusalem toall them that were of the captivity, that they should begathered together at Jerusalem:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	4	And that whosoever met not there within two or three daysaccording as the elders that bare rule appointed, their cattleshould be seized to the use of the temple, and himself cast outfrom them that were of the captivity.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	5	And in three days were all they of the tribe of Judah andBenjamin gathered together at Jerusalem the twentieth day of theninth month.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	6	And all the multitude sat trembling in the broad court of thetemple because of the present foul weather.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	7	So Esdras arose up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressedthe law in marrying strange wives, thereby to increase the sinsof Israel.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	8	And now by confessing give glory unto the Lord God of ourfathers,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	9	And do his will, and separate yourselves from the heathen ofthe land, and from the strange women.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	10	Then cried the whole multitude, and said with a loud voice,Like as thou hast spoken, so will we do.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	11	But forasmuch as the people are many, and it is foul weather,so that we cannot stand without, and this is not a work of a dayor two, seeing our sin in these things is spread far:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	12	Therefore let the rulers of the multitude stay, and let allthem of our habitations that have strange wives come at the timeappointed,
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	13	And with them the rulers and judges of every place, till weturn away the wrath of the Lord from us for this matter.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	14	Then Jonathan the son of Azael and Ezechias the son ofTheocanus accordingly took this matter upon them: and Mosollamand Levis and Sabbatheus helped them.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	15	And they that were of the captivity did according to allthese things.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	16	And Esdras the priest chose unto him the principal men oftheir families, all by name: and in the first day of the tenthmonth they sat together to examine the matter.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	17	So their cause that held strange wives was brought to an endin the first day of the first month.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	18	And of the priests that were come together, and had strangewives, there were found:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	19	Of the sons of Jesus the son of Josedec, and his brethren;Matthelas and Eleazar, and Joribus and Joadanus.

The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	37	And the priests and Levites, and they that were of Israel,dwelt in Jerusalem, and in the country, in the first day of theseventh month: so the children of Israel were in theirhabitations.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	38	And the whole multitude came together with one accord intothe broad place of the holy porch toward the east:
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	39	And they spake unto Esdras the priest and reader, that hewould bring the law of Moses, that was given of the Lord God ofIsrael.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	40	So Esdras the chief priest brought the law unto the wholemultitude from man to woman, and to all the priests, to hear lawin the first day of the seventh month.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	41	And he read in the broad court before the holy porch frommorning unto midday, before both men and women; and themultitude gave heed unto the law.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	42	And Esdras the priest and reader of the law stood up upon apulpit of wood, which was made for that purpose.

The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	44	And upon his left hand stood Phaldaius, Misael, Melchias,Lothasubus, and Nabarias.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	45	Then took Esdras the book of the law before the multitude:for he sat honourably in the first place in the sight of themall.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	46	And when he opened the law, they stood all straight up. SoEsdras blessed the Lord God most High, the God of hosts,Almighty.

The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	52	For this day is holy unto the Lord: and be not sorrowful; forthe Lord will bring you to honour.
The First Book of Esdras	1Esdr	9	53	So the Levites published all things to the people, saying,This day is holy to the Lord; be not sorrowful.

The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	7	Am not I even he that brought them out of the land of Egypt,from the house of bondage? but they have provoked me unto wrath,and despised my counsels.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	8	Pull thou off then the hair of thy head, and cast all evil upon them, for they have not been obedient unto my law, but it is a rebellious people.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	9	How long shall I forbear them, into whom I have done so much good?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	10	Many kings have I destroyed for their sakes; Pharaoh with hisservants and all his power have I smitten down.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	11	All the nations have I destroyed before them, and in the eastI have scattered the people of two provinces, even of Tyrus andSidon, and have slain all their enemies.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	12	Speak thou therefore unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	13	I led you through the sea and in the beginning gave you a large and safe passage; I gave you Moses for a leader, and Aaron for a priest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	14	I gave you light in a pillar of fire, and great wonders haveI done among you; yet have ye forgotten me, saith the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	15	Thus saith the Almighty Lord, The quails were as a token to you; I gave you tents for your safeguard: nevertheless ye murmured there,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	16	And triumphed not in my name for the destruction of your enemies, but ever to this day do ye yet murmur.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	17	Where are the benefits that I have done for you? when ye werehungry and thirsty in the wilderness, did ye not cry unto me,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	18	Saying, Why hast thou brought us into this wilderness to kill us? it had been better for us to have served the Egyptians, than to die in this wilderness.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	19	Then had I pity upon your mournings, and gave you manna to eat; so ye did eat angels' bread.

The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	30	I gathered you together, as a hen gathereth her chickensunder her wings: but now, what shall I do unto you? I will castyou out from my face.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	31	When ye offer unto me, I will turn my face from you: for yoursolemn feastdays, your new moons, and your circumcisions, have Iforsaken.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	32	I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have takenand slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I willrequire of your hands, saith the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	33	Thus saith the Almighty Lord, Your house is desolate, I willcast you out as the wind doth stubble.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	34	And your children shall not be fruitful; for they havedespised my commandment, and done the thing that is an evilbefore me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	35	Your houses will I give to a people that shall come; whichnot having heard of me yet shall believe me; to whom I haveshewed no signs, yet they shall do that I have commanded them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	36	They have seen no prophets, yet they shall call their sins toremembrance, and acknowledge them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	37	I take to witness the grace of the people to come, whoselittle ones rejoice in gladness: and though they have not seenme with bodily eyes, yet in spirit they believe the thing that Isay.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	38	And now, brother, behold what glory; and see the people thatcome from the east:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	39	Unto whom I will give for leaders, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,Oseas, Amos, and Micheas, Joel, Abdias, and Jonas,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	1	40	Nahum, and Abacuc, Sophonias, Aggeus, Zachary, and Malachy,which is called also an angel of the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	1	Thus saith the Lord, I brought this people out of bondage,and I gave them my commandments by menservants the prophets;whom they would not hear, but despised my counsels.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	2	The mother that bare them saith unto them, Go your way, yechildren; for I am a widow and forsaken.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	3	I brought you up with gladness; but with sorrow and heavinesshave I lost you: for ye have sinned before the Lord your God,and done that thing that is evil before him.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	4	But what shall I now do unto you? I am a widow and forsaken:go your way, O my children, and ask mercy of the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	5	As for me, O father, I call upon thee for a witness over themother of these children, which would not keep my covenant,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	6	That thou bring them to confusion, and their mother to aspoil, that there may be no offspring of them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	7	Let them be scattered abroad among the heathen, let theirnames be put out of the earth: for they have despised mycovenant.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	8	Woe be unto thee, Assur, thou that hidest the unrighteous inthee! O thou wicked people, remember what I did unto Sodom andGomorrha;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	9	Whose land lieth in clods of pitch and heaps of ashes: evenso also will I do unto them that hear me not, saith the AlmightyLord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	10	Thus saith the Lord unto Esdras, Tell my people that I willgive them the kingdom of Jerusalem, which I would have givenunto Israel.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	11	Their glory also will I take unto me, and give these theeverlasting tabernacles, which I had prepared for them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	12	They shall have the tree of life for an ointment of sweetsavour; they shall neither labour, nor be weary.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	13	Go, and ye shall receive: pray for few days unto you, thatthey may be shortened: the kingdom is already prepared for you:watch.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	14	Take heaven and earth to witness; for I have broken the evilin pieces, and created the good: for I live, saith the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	15	Mother, embrace thy children, and bring them up withgladness, make their feet as fast as a pillar: for I have chosenthee, saith the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	16	And those that be dead will I raise up again from theirplaces, and bring them out of the graves: for I have known myname in Israel.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	17	Fear not, thou mother of the children: for I have chosenthee, saith the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	18	For thy help will I send my servants Esau and Jeremy, afterwhose counsel I have sanctified and prepared for thee twelvetrees laden with divers fruits,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	19	And as many fountains flowing with milk and honey, and sevenmighty mountains, whereupon there grow roses and lilies, wherebyI will fill thy children with joy.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	20	Do right to the widow, judge for the fatherless, give to thepoor, defend the orphan, clothe the naked,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	21	Heal the broken and the weak, laugh not a lame man to scorn,defend the maimed, and let the blind man come into the sight ofmy clearness.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	22	Keep the old and young within thy walls.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	23	Wheresoever thou findest the dead, take them and bury them,and I will give thee the first place in my resurrection.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	24	Abide still, O my people, and take thy rest, for thyquietness still come.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	25	Nourish thy children, O thou good nurse; stablish their feet.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	26	As for the servants whom I have given thee, there shall notone of them perish; for I will require them from among thynumber.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	27	Be not weary: for when the day of trouble and heavinesscometh, others shall weep and be sorrowful, but thou shalt bemerry and have abundance.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	28	The heathen shall envy thee, but they shall be able to donothing against thee, saith the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	29	My hands shall cover thee, so that thy children shall not seehell.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	30	Be joyful, O thou mother, with thy children; for I willdeliver thee, saith the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	31	Remember thy children that sleep, for I shall bring them outof the sides of the earth, and shew mercy unto them: for I ammerciful, saith the Lord Almighty.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	32	Embrace thy children until I come and shew mercy unto them:for my wells run over, and my grace shall not fail.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	33	I Esdras received a charge of the Lord upon the mount Oreb,that I should go unto Israel; but when I came unto them, theyset me at nought, and despised the commandment of the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	34	And therefore I say unto you, O ye heathen, that hear andunderstand, look for your Shepherd, he shall give youeverlasting rest; for he is nigh at hand, that shall come in theend of the world.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	35	Be ready to the reward of the kingdom, for the everlastinglight shall shine upon you for evermore.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	36	Flee the shadow of this world, receive the joyfulness of yourglory: I testify my Saviour openly.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	37	O receive the gift that is given you, and be glad, givingthanks unto him that hath led you to the heavenly kingdom.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	38	Arise up and stand, behold the number of those that be sealedin the feast of the Lord;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	39	Which are departed from the shadow of the world, and havereceived glorious garments of the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	40	Take thy number, O Sion, and shut up those of thine that areclothed in white, which have fulfilled the law of the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	41	The number of thy children, whom thou longedst for, isfulfilled: beseech the power of the Lord, that thy people, whichhave been called from the beginning, may be hallowed.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	42	I Esdras saw upon the mount Sion a great people, whom I couldnot number, and they all praised the Lord with songs.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	43	And in the midst of them there was a young man of a highstature, taller than all the rest, and upon every one of theirheads he set crowns, and was more exalted; which I marvelled atgreatly.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	44	So I asked the angel, and said, Sir, what are these?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	45	He answered and said unto me, These be they that have put offthe mortal clothing, and put on the immortal, and have confessedthe name of God: now are they crowned, and receive palms.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	46	Then said I unto the angel, What young person is it thatcrowneth them, and giveth them palms in their hands?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	47	So he answered and said unto me, It is the Son of God, whomthey have confessed in the world. Then began I greatly tocommend them that stood so stiffly for the name of the Lord.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	2	48	Then the angel said unto me, Go thy way, and tell my peoplewhat manner of things, and how great wonders of the Lord thyGod, thou hast seen.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	1	In the thirtieth year after the ruin of the city I was inBabylon, and lay troubled upon my bed, and my thoughts came upover my heart:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	2	For I saw the desolation of Sion, and the wealth of them thatdwelt at Babylon.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	3	And my spirit was sore moved, so that I began to speak wordsfull of fear to the most High, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	4	O Lord, who bearest rule, thou spakest at the beginning, whenthou didst plant the earth, and that thyself alone, andcommandedst the people,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	5	And gavest a body unto Adam without soul, which was theworkmanship of thine hands, and didst breathe into him thebreath of life, and he was made living before thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	6	And thou leadest him into paradise, which thy right hand hadplanted, before ever the earth came forward.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	7	And unto him thou gavest commandment to love thy way: whichhe transgressed, and immediately thou appointedst death in himand in his generations, of whom came nations, tribes, people,and kindreds, out of number.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	8	And every people walked after their own will, and didwonderful things before thee, and despised thy commandments.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	9	And again in process of time thou broughtest the flood uponthose that dwelt in the world, and destroyedst them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	10	And it came to pass in every of them, that as death was toAdam, so was the flood to these.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	11	Nevertheless one of them thou leftest, namely, Noah with hishousehold, of whom came all righteous men.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	12	And it happened, that when they that dwelt upon the earthbegan to multiply, and had gotten them many children, and were agreat people, they began again to be more ungodly than thefirst.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	13	Now when they lived so wickedly before thee, thou didstchoose thee a man from among them, whose name was Abraham.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	14	Him thou lovedst, and unto him only thou shewedst thy will:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	15	And madest an everlasting covenant with him, promising himthat thou wouldest never forsake his seed.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	16	And unto him thou gavest Isaac, and unto Isaac also thougavest Jacob and Esau. As for Jacob, thou didst choose him tothee, and put by Esau: and so Jacob became a great multitude.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	17	And it came to pass, that when thou leadest his seed out ofEgypt, thou broughtest them up to the mount Sinai.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	18	And bowing the heavens, thou didst set fast the earth,movedst the whole world, and madest the depths to tremble, andtroubledst the men of that age.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	19	And thy glory went through four gates, of fire, and ofearthquake, and of wind, and of cold; that thou mightest givethe law unto the seed of Jacob, and diligence unto thegeneration of Israel.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	20	And yet tookest thou not away from them a wicked heart, thatthy law might bring forth fruit in them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	21	For the first Adam bearing a wicked heart transgressed, andwas overcome; and so be all they that are born of him.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	22	Thus infirmity was made permanent; and the law (also) in theheart of the people with the malignity of the root; so that thegood departed away, and the evil abode still.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	23	So the times passed away, and the years were brought to anend: then didst thou raise thee up a servant, called David:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	24	Whom thou commandedst to build a city unto thy name, and tooffer incense and oblations unto thee therein.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	25	When this was done many years, then they that inhabited thecity forsook thee,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	26	And in all things did even as Adam and all his generationshad done: for they also had a wicked heart:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	27	And so thou gavest thy city over into the hands of thineenemies.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	28	Are their deeds then any better that inhabit Babylon, thatthey should therefore have the dominion over Sion?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	29	For when I came thither, and had seen impieties withoutnumber, then my soul saw many evildoers in this thirtieth year,so that my heart failed me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	30	For I have seen how thou sufferest them sinning, and hastspared wicked doers: and hast destroyed thy people, and hastpreserved thine enemies, and hast not signified it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	31	I do not remember how this way may be left: Are they then ofBabylon better than they of Sion?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	32	Or is there any other people that knoweth thee beside Israel?or what generation hath so believed thy covenants as Jacob?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	33	And yet their reward appeareth not, and their labour hath nofruit: for I have gone here and there through the heathen, and Isee that they flow in wealth, and think not upon thycommandments.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	34	Weigh thou therefore our wickedness now in the balance, andtheir's also that dwell the world; and so shall thy name nowhere be found but in Israel.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	35	Or when was it that they which dwell upon the earth have notsinned in thy sight? or what people have so kept thycommandments?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	3	36	Thou shalt find that Israel by name hath kept thy precepts;but not the heathen.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	1	And the angel that was sent unto me, whose name was Uriel,gave me an answer,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	2	And said, Thy heart hath gone to far in this world, andthinkest thou to comprehend the way of the most High?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	3	Then said I, Yea, my lord. And he answered me, and said, I amsent to shew thee three ways, and to set forth three similitudesbefore thee:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	4	Whereof if thou canst declare me one, I will shew thee alsothe way that thou desirest to see, and I shall shew thee fromwhence the wicked heart cometh.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	5	And I said, Tell on, my lord. Then said he unto me, Go thyway, weigh me the weight of the fire, or measure me the blast ofthe wind, or call me again the day that is past.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	6	Then answered I and said, What man is able to do that, thatthou shouldest ask such things of me?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	7	And he said unto me, If I should ask thee how great dwellingsare in the midst of the sea, or how many springs are in thebeginning of the deep, or how many springs are above thefirmament, or which are the outgoings of paradise:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	8	Peradventure thou wouldest say unto me, I never went downinto the deep, nor as yet into hell, neither did I ever climb upinto heaven.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	9	Nevertheless now have I asked thee but only of the fire andwind, and of the day wherethrough thou hast passed, and ofthings from which thou canst not be separated, and yet canstthou give me no answer of them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	10	He said moreover unto me, Thine own things, and such as aregrown up with thee, canst thou not know;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	11	How should thy vessel then be able to comprehend the way ofthe Highest, and, the world being now outwardly corrupted tounderstand the corruption that is evident in my sight?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	12	Then said I unto him, It were better that we were not at all,than that we should live still in wickedness, and to suffer, andnot to know wherefore.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	13	He answered me, and said, I went into a forest into a plain,and the trees took counsel,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	14	And said, Come, let us go and make war against the sea thatit may depart away before us, and that we may make us morewoods.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	15	The floods of the sea also in like manner took counsel, andsaid, Come, let us go up and subdue the woods of the plain, thatthere also we may make us another country.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	16	The thought of the wood was in vain, for the fire came andconsumed it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	17	The thought of the floods of the sea came likewise to nought,for the sand stood up and stopped them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	18	If thou wert judge now betwixt these two, whom wouldest thoubegin to justify? or whom wouldest thou condemn?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	19	I answered and said, Verily it is a foolish thought that theyboth have devised, for the ground is given unto the wood, andthe sea also hath his place to bear his floods.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	20	Then answered he me, and said, Thou hast given a rightjudgment, but why judgest thou not thyself also?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	21	For like as the ground is given unto the wood, and the sea tohis floods: even so they that dwell upon the earth mayunderstand nothing but that which is upon the earth: and he thatdwelleth above the heavens may only understand the things thatare above the height of the heavens.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	22	Then answered I and said, I beseech thee, O Lord, let me haveunderstanding:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	23	For it was not my mind to be curious of the high things, butof such as pass by us daily, namely, wherefore Israel is givenup as a reproach to the heathen, and for what cause the peoplewhom thou hast loved is given over unto ungodly nations, and whythe law of our forefathers is brought to nought, and the writtencovenants come to none effect,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	24	And we pass away out of the world as grasshoppers, and ourlife is astonishment and fear, and we are not worthy to obtainmercy.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	25	What will he then do unto his name whereby we are called? ofthese things have I asked.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	26	Then answered he me, and said, The more thou searchest, themore thou shalt marvel; for the world hasteth fast to pass away,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	27	And cannot comprehend the things that are promised to therighteous in time to come: for this world is full ofunrighteousness and infirmities.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	28	But as concerning the things whereof thou askest me, I willtell thee; for the evil is sown, but the destruction thereof isnot yet come.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	29	If therefore that which is sown be not turned upside down,and if the place where the evil is sown pass not away, thencannot it come that is sown with good.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	30	For the grain of evil seed hath been sown in the heart ofAdam from the beginning, and how much ungodliness hath itbrought up unto this time? and how much shall it yet bring forthuntil the time of threshing come?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	31	Ponder now by thyself, how great fruit of wickedness thegrain of evil seed hath brought forth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	32	And when the ears shall be cut down, which are withoutnumber, how great a floor shall they fill?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	33	Then I answered and said, How, and when shall these thingscome to pass? wherefore are our years few and evil?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	34	And he answered me, saying, Do not thou hasten above the mostHighest: for thy haste is in vain to be above him, for thou hastmuch exceeded.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	35	Did not the souls also of the righteous ask question of thesethings in their chambers, saying, How long shall I hope on thisfashion? when cometh the fruit of the floor of our reward?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	36	And unto these things Uriel the archangel gave them answer,and said, Even when the number of seeds is filled in you: for hehath weighed the world in the balance.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	37	By measure hath he measured the times; and by number hath henumbered the times; and he doth not move nor stir them, untilthe said measure be fulfilled.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	38	Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, even weall are full of impiety.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	39	And for our sakes peradventure it is that the floors of therighteous are not filled, because of the sins of them that dwellupon the earth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	40	So he answered me, and said, Go thy way to a woman withchild, and ask of her when she hath fulfilled her nine months,if her womb may keep the birth any longer within her.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	41	Then said I, No, Lord, that can she not. And he said unto me,In the grave the chambers of souls are like the womb of a woman:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	42	For like as a woman that travaileth maketh haste to escapethe necessity of the travail: even so do these places haste todeliver those things that are committed unto them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	43	From the beginning, look, what thou desirest to see, it shallbe shewed thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	44	Then answered I and said, If I have found favour in thysight, and if it be possible, and if I be meet therefore,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	45	Shew me then whether there be more to come than is past, ormore past than is to come.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	46	What is past I know, but what is for to come I know not.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	47	And he said unto me, Stand up upon the right side, and Ishall expound the similitude unto thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	48	So I stood, and saw, and, behold, an hot burning oven passedby before me: and it happened that when the flame was gone by Ilooked, and, behold, the smoke remained still.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	49	After this there passed by before me a watery cloud, and sentdown much rain with a storm; and when the stormy rain was past,the drops remained still.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	50	Then said he unto me, Consider with thyself; as the rain ismore than the drops, and as the fire is greater than the smoke;but the drops and the smoke remain behind: so the quantity whichis past did more exceed.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	51	Then I prayed, and said, May I live, thinkest thou, untilthat time? or what shall happen in those days?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	4	52	He answered me, and said, As for the tokens whereof thouaskest me, I may tell thee of them in part: but as touching thylife, I am not sent to shew thee; for I do not know it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	1	Nevertheless as coming the tokens, behold, the days shallcome, that they which dwell upon earth shall be taken in a greatnumber, and the way of truth shall be hidden, and the land shallbe barren of faith.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	2	But iniquity shall be increased above that which now thouseest, or that thou hast heard long ago.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	3	And the land, that thou seest now to have root, shalt thousee wasted suddenly.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	4	But if the most High grant thee to live, thou shalt see afterthe third trumpet that the sun shall suddenly shine again in thenight, and the moon thrice in the day:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	5	And blood shall drop out of wood, and the stone shall givehis voice, and the people shall be troubled:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	6	And even he shall rule, whom they look not for that dwellupon the earth, and the fowls shall take their flight awaytogether:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	7	And the Sodomitish sea shall cast out fish, and make a noisein the night, which many have not known: but they shall all hearthe voice thereof.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	8	There shall be a confusion also in many places, and the fireshall be oft sent out again, and the wild beasts shall changetheir places, and menstruous women shall bring forth monsters:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	9	And salt waters shall be found in the sweet, and all friendsshall destroy one another; then shall wit hide itself, andunderstanding withdraw itself into his secret chamber,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	10	And shall be sought of many, and yet not be found: then shallunrighteousness and incontinency be multiplied upon earth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	11	One land also shall ask another, and say, Is righteousnessthat maketh a man righteous gone through thee? And it shall say,No.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	12	At the same time shall men hope, but nothing obtain: theyshall labour, but their ways shall not prosper.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	13	To shew thee such tokens I have leave; and if thou wilt prayagain, and weep as now, and fast even days, thou shalt hear yetgreater things.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	14	Then I awaked, and an extreme fearfulness went through all mybody, and my mind was troubled, so that it fainted.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	15	So the angel that was come to talk with me held me, comfortedme, and set me up upon my feet.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	16	And in the second night it came to pass, that Salathiel thecaptain of the people came unto me, saying, Where hast thoubeen? and why is thy countenance so heavy?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	17	Knowest thou not that Israel is committed unto thee in theland of their captivity?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	18	Up then, and eat bread, and forsake us not, as the shepherdthat leaveth his flock in the hands of cruel wolves.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	19	Then said I unto him, Go thy ways from me, and come not nighme. And he heard what I said, and went from me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	20	And so I fasted seven days, mourning and weeping, like asUriel the angel commanded me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	21	And after seven days so it was, that the thoughts of my heartwere very grievous unto me again,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	22	And my soul recovered the spirit of understanding, and Ibegan to talk with the most High again,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	23	And said, O Lord that bearest rule, of every wood of theearth, and of all the trees thereof, thou hast chosen thee oneonly vine:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	24	And of all lands of the whole world thou hast chosen thee onepit: and of all the flowers thereof one lily:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	25	And of all the depths of the sea thou hast filled thee oneriver: and of all builded cities thou hast hallowed Sion untothyself:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	26	And of all the fowls that are created thou hast named theeone dove: and of all the cattle that are made thou hast providedthee one sheep:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	27	And among all the multitudes of people thou hast gotten theeone people: and unto this people, whom thou lovedst, thou gavesta law that is approved of all.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	28	And now, O Lord, why hast thou given this one people overunto many? and upon the one root hast thou prepared others, andwhy hast thou scattered thy only one people among many?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	29	And they which did gainsay thy promises, and believed not thycovenants, have trodden them down.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	30	If thou didst so much hate thy people, yet shouldest thoupunish them with thine own hands.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	31	Now when I had spoken these words, the angel that came to methe night afore was sent unto me,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	32	And said unto me, Hear me, and I will instruct thee; hearkento the thing that I say, and I shall tell thee more.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	33	And I said, Speak on, my Lord. Then said he unto me, Thou artsore troubled in mind for Israel's sake: lovest thou that peoplebetter than he that made them?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	34	And I said, No, Lord: but of very grief have I spoken: for myreins pain me every hour, while I labour to comprehend the wayof the most High, and to seek out part of his judgment.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	35	And he said unto me, Thou canst not. And I said, Wherefore,Lord? whereunto was I born then? or why was not my mother's wombthen my grave, that I might not have seen the travail of Jacob,and the wearisome toil of the stock of Israel?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	36	And he said unto me, Number me the things that are not yetcome, gather me together the dross that are scattered abroad,make me the flowers green again that are withered,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	37	Open me the places that are closed, and bring me forth thewinds that in them are shut up, shew me the image of a voice:and then I will declare to thee the thing that thou labourest toknow.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	38	And I said, O Lord that bearest rule, who may know thesethings, but he that hath not his dwelling with men?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	39	As for me, I am unwise: how may I then speak of these thingswhereof thou askest me?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	40	Then said he unto me, Like as thou canst do none of thesethings that I have spoken of, even so canst thou not find out myjudgment, or in the end the love that I have promised unto mypeople.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	41	And I said, Behold, O Lord, yet art thou nigh unto them thatbe reserved till the end: and what shall they do that have beenbefore me, or we that be now, or they that shall come after us?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	42	And he said unto me, I will liken my judgment unto a ring:like as there is no slackness of the last, even so there is noswiftness of the first.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	43	So I answered and said, Couldest thou not make those thathave been made, and be now, and that are for to come, at once;that thou mightest shew thy judgment the sooner?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	44	Then answered he me, and said, The creature may not hasteabove the maker; neither may the world hold them at once thatshall be created therein.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	45	And I said, As thou hast said unto thy servant, that thou,which givest life to all, hast given life at once to thecreature that thou hast created, and the creature bare it: evenso it might now also bear them that now be present at once.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	46	And he said unto me, Ask the womb of a woman, and say untoher, If thou bringest forth children, why dost thou it nottogether, but one after another? pray her therefore to bringforth ten children at once.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	47	And I said, She cannot: but must do it by distance of time.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	48	Then said he unto me, Even so have I given the womb of theearth to those that be sown in it in their times.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	49	For like as a young child may not bring forth the things thatbelong to the aged, even so have I disposed the world which Icreated.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	50	And I asked, and said, Seeing thou hast now given me the way,I will proceed to speak before thee: for our mother, of whomthou hast told me that she is young, draweth now nigh unto age.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	51	He answered me, and said, Ask a woman that beareth children,and she shall tell thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	52	Say unto her, Wherefore are unto they whom thou hast nowbrought forth like those that were before, but less of stature?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	53	And she shall answer thee, They that be born in the thestrength of youth are of one fashion, and they that are born inthe time of age, when the womb faileth, are otherwise.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	54	Consider thou therefore also, how that ye are less of staturethan those that were before you.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	55	And so are they that come after you less than ye, as thecreatures which now begin to be old, and have passed over thestrength of youth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	5	56	Then said I, Lord, I beseech thee, if I have found favour inthy sight, shew thy servant by whom thou visitest thy creature.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	1	And he said unto me, In the beginning, when the earth wasmade, before the borders of the world stood, or ever the windsblew,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	2	Before it thundered and lightened, or ever the foundations ofparadise were laid,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	3	Before the fair flowers were seen, or ever the moveablepowers were established, before the innumerable multitude ofangels were gathered together,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	4	Or ever the heights of the air were lifted up, before themeasures of the firmament were named, or ever the chimneys inSion were hot,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	5	And ere the present years were sought out, and or ever theinventions of them that now sin were turned, before they weresealed that have gathered faith for a treasure:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	6	Then did I consider these things, and they all were madethrough me alone, and through none other: by me also they shallbe ended, and by none other.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	7	Then answered I and said, What shall be the parting asunderof the times? or when shall be the end of the first, and thebeginning of it that followeth?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	8	And he said unto me, From Abraham unto Isaac, when Jacob andEsau were born of him, Jacob's hand held first the heel of Esau.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	9	For Esau is the end of the world, and Jacob is the beginningof it that followeth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	10	The hand of man is betwixt the heel and the hand: otherquestion, Esdras, ask thou not.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	11	I answered then and said, O Lord that bearest rule, if I havefound favour in thy sight,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	12	I beseech thee, shew thy servant the end of thy tokens,whereof thou shewedst me part the last night.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	13	So he answered and said unto me, Stand up upon thy feet, andhear a mighty sounding voice.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	14	And it shall be as it were a great motion; but the placewhere thou standest shall not be moved.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	15	And therefore when it speaketh be not afraid: for the word isof the end, and the foundation of the earth is understood.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	16	And why? because the speech of these things trembleth and ismoved: for it knoweth that the end of these things must bechanged.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	17	And it happened, that when I had heard it I stood up upon myfeet, and hearkened, and, behold, there was a voice that spake,and the sound of it was like the sound of many waters.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	18	And it said, Behold, the days come, that I will begin to drawnigh, and to visit them that dwell upon the earth,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	19	And will begin to make inquisition of them, what they be thathave hurt unjustly with their unrighteousness, and when theaffliction of Sion shall be fulfilled;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	20	And when the world, that shall begin to vanish away, shall befinished, then will I shew these tokens: the books shall beopened before the firmament, and they shall see all together:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	21	And the children of a year old shall speak with their voices,the women with child shall bring forth untimely children ofthree or four months old, and they shall live, and be raised up.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	22	And suddenly shall the sown places appear unsown, the fullstorehouses shall suddenly be found empty:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	23	And tha trumpet shall give a sound, which when every manheareth, they shall be suddenly afraid.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	24	At that time shall friends fight one against another likeenemies, and the earth shall stand in fear with those that dwelltherein, the springs of the fountains shall stand still, and inthree hours they shall not run.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	25	Whosoever remaineth from all these that I have told theeshall escape, and see my salvation, and the end of your world.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	26	And the men that are received shall see it, who have nottasted death from their birth: and the heart of the inhabitantsshall be changed, and turned into another meaning.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	27	For evil shall be put out, and deceit shall be quenched.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	28	As for faith, it shall flourish, corruption shall beovercome, and the truth, which hath been so long without fruit,shall be declared.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	29	And when he talked with me, behold, I looked by little andlittle upon him before whom I stood.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	30	And these words said he unto me; I am come to shew thee thetime of the night to come.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	31	If thou wilt pray yet more, and fast seven days again, Ishall tell thee greater things by day than I have heard.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	32	For thy voice is heard before the most High: for the Mightyhath seen thy righteous dealing, he hath seen also thy chastity,which thou hast had ever since thy youth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	33	And therefore hath he sent me to shew thee all these things,and to say unto thee, Be of good comfort and fear not
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	34	And hasten not with the times that are past, to think vainthings, that thou mayest not hasten from the latter times.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	35	And it came to pass after this, that I wept again, and fastedseven days in like manner, that I might fulfil the three weekswhich he told me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	36	And in the eighth night was my heart vexed within me again,and I began to speak before the most High.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	37	For my spirit was greatly set on fire, and my soul was indistress.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	38	And I said, O Lord, thou spakest from the beginning of thecreation, even the first day, and saidst thus; Let heaven andearth be made; and thy word was a perfect work.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	39	And then was the spirit, and darkness and silence were onevery side; the sound of man's voice was not yet formed.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	40	Then commandedst thou a fair light to come forth of thytreasures, that thy work might appear.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	41	Upon the second day thou madest the spirit of the firmament,and commandedst it to part asunder, and to make a divisionbetwixt the waters, that the one part might go up, and the otherremain beneath.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	42	Upon the third day thou didst command that the waters shouldbe gathered in the seventh part of the earth: six pats hast thoudried up, and kept them, to the intent that of these some beingplanted of God and tilled might serve thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	43	For as soon as thy word went forth the work was made.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	44	For immediately there was great and innumerable fruit, andmany and divers pleasures for the taste, and flowers ofunchangeable colour, and odours of wonderful smell: and this wasdone the third day.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	45	Upon the fourth day thou commandedst that the sun shouldshine, and the moon give her light, and the stars should be inorder:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	46	And gavest them a charge to do service unto man, that was tobe made.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	47	Upon the fifth day thou saidst unto the seventh part, wherethe waters were gathered that it should bring forth livingcreatures, fowls and fishes: and so it came to pass.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	48	For the dumb water and without life brought forth livingthings at the commandment of God, that all people might praisethy wondrous works.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	49	Then didst thou ordain two living creatures, the one thoucalledst Enoch, and the other Leviathan;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	50	And didst separate the one from the other: for the seventhpart, namely, where the water was gathered together, might nothold them both.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	51	Unto Enoch thou gavest one part, which was dried up the thirdday, that he should dwell in the same part, wherein are athousand hills:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	52	But unto Leviathan thou gavest the seventh part, namely, themoist; and hast kept him to be devoured of whom thou wilt, andwhen.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	53	Upon the sixth day thou gavest commandment unto the earth,that before thee it should bring forth beasts, cattle, andcreeping things:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	54	And after these, Adam also, whom thou madest lord of all thycreatures: of him come we all, and the people also whom thouhast chosen.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	55	All this have I spoken before thee, O Lord, because thoumadest the world for our sakes
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	56	As for the other people, which also come of Adam, thou hastsaid that they are nothing, but be like unto spittle: and hastlikened the abundance of them unto a drop that falleth from avessel.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	57	And now, O Lord, behold, these heathen, which have ever beenreputed as nothing, have begun to be lords over us, and todevour us.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	58	But we thy people, whom thou hast called thy firstborn, thyonly begotten, and thy fervent lover, are given into theirhands.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	6	59	If the world now be made for our sakes, why do we not possessan inheritance with the world? how long shall this endure?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	1	And when I had made an end of speaking these words, there wassent unto me the angel which had been sent unto me the nightsafore:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	2	And he said unto me, Up, Esdras, and hear the words that I amcome to tell thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	3	And I said, Speak on, my God. Then said he unto me, The seais set in a wide place, that it might be deep and great.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	4	But put the case the entrance were narrow, and like a river;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	5	Who then could go into the sea to look upon it, and to ruleit? if he went not through the narrow, how could he come intothe broad?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	6	There is also another thing; A city is builded, and set upona broad field, and is full of all good things:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	7	The entrance thereof is narrow, and is set in a dangerousplace to fall, like as if there were a fire on the right hand,and on the left a deep water:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	8	And one only path between them both, even between the fireand the water, so small that there could but one man go there atonce.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	9	If this city now were given unto a man for an inheritance, ifhe never shall pass the danger set before it, how shall hereceive this inheritance?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	10	And I said, It is so, Lord. Then said he unto me, Even soalso is Israel's portion.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	11	Because for their sakes I made the world: and when Adamtransgressed my statutes, then was decreed that now is done.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	12	Then were the entrances of this world made narrow, full ofsorrow and travail: they are but few and evil, full of perils,:and very painful.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	13	For the entrances of the elder world were wide and sure, andbrought immortal fruit.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	14	If then they that live labour not to enter these strait andvain things, they can never receive those that are laid up forthem.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	15	Now therefore why disquietest thou thyself, seeing thou artbut a corruptible man? and why art thou moved, whereas thou artbut mortal?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	16	Why hast thou not considered in thy mind this thing that isto come, rather than that which is present?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	17	Then answered I and said, O Lord that bearest rule, thou hastordained in thy law, that the righteous should inherit thesethings, but that the ungodly should perish.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	18	Nevertheless the righteous shall suffer strait things, andhope for wide: for they that have done wickedly have sufferedthe strait things, and yet shall not see the wide.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	19	And he said unto me. There is no judge above God, and nonethat hath understanding above the Highest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	20	For there be many that perish in this life, because theydespise the law of God that is set before them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	21	For God hath given strait commandment to such as came, whatthey should do to live, even as they came, and what they shouldobserve to avoid punishment.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	22	Nevertheless they were not obedient unto him; but spakeagainst him, and imagined vain things;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	23	And deceived themselves by their wicked deeds; and said ofthe most High, that he is not; and knew not his ways:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	24	But his law have they despised, and denied his covenants; inhis statutes have they not been faithful, and have not performedhis works.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	25	And therefore, Esdras, for the empty are empty things, andfor the full are the full things.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	26	Behold, the time shall come, that these tokens which I havetold thee shall come to pass, and the bride shall appear, andshe coming forth shall be seen, that now is withdrawn from theearth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	27	And whosoever is delivered from the foresaid evils shall seemy wonders.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	28	For my son Jesus shall be revealed with those that be withhim, and they that remain shall rejoice within four hundredyears.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	29	After these years shall my son Christ die, and all men thathave life.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	30	And the world shall be turned into the old silence sevendays, like as in the former judgments: so that no man shallremain.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	31	And after seven days the world, that yet awaketh not, shallbe raised up, and that shall die that is corrupt
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	32	And the earth shall restore those that are asleep in her, andso shall the dust those that dwell in silence, and the secretplaces shall deliver those souls that were committed unto them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	33	And the most High shall appear upon the seat of judgment, andmisery shall pass away, and the long suffering shall have anend:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	34	But judgment only shall remain, truth shall stand, and faithshall wax strong:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	35	And the work shall follow, and the reward shall be shewed,and the good deeds shall be of force, and wicked deeds shallbear no rule.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	36	Then said I, Abraham prayed first for the Sodomites, andMoses for the fathers that sinned in the wilderness:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	37	And Jesus after him for Israel in the time of Achan:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	38	And Samuel and David for the destruction: and Solomon forthem that should come to the sanctuary:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	39	And Helias for those that received rain; and for the dead,that he might live:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	40	And Ezechias for the people in the time of Sennacherib: andmany for many.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	41	Even so now, seeing corruption is grown up, and wickednessincreased, and the righteous have prayed for the ungodly:wherefore shall it not be so now also?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	42	He answered me, and said, This present life is not the endwhere much glory doth abide; therefore have they prayed for theweak.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	43	But the day of doom shall be the end of this time, and thebeginning of the immortality for to come, wherein corruption ispast,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	44	Intemperance is at an end, infidelity is cut off,righteousness is grown, and truth is sprung up.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	45	Then shall no man be able to save him that is destroyed, norto oppress him that hath gotten the victory.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	46	I answered then and said, This is my first and last saying,that it had been better not to have given the earth unto Adam:or else, when it was given him, to have restrained him fromsinning.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	47	For what profit is it for men now in this present time tolive in heaviness, and after death to look for punishment?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	48	O thou Adam, what hast thou done? for though it was thou thatsinned, thou art not fallen alone, but we all that come of thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	49	For what profit is it unto us, if there be promised us animmortal time, whereas we have done the works that bring death?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	50	And that there is promised us an everlasting hope, whereasourselves being most wicked are made vain?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	51	And that there are laid up for us dwellings of health andsafety, whereas we have lived wickedly?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	52	And that the glory of the most High is kept to defend themwhich have led a wary life, whereas we have walked in the mostwicked ways of all?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	53	And that there should be shewed a paradise, whose fruitendureth for ever, wherein is security and medicine, since weshall not enter into it?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	54	(For we have walked in unpleasant places.)
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	55	And that the faces of them which have used abstinence shallshine above the stars, whereas our faces shall be blacker thandarkness?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	56	For while we lived and committed iniquity, we considered notthat we should begin to suffer for it after death.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	57	Then answered he me, and said, This is the condition of thebattle, which man that is born upon the earth shall fight;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	58	That, if he be overcome, he shall suffer as thou hast said:but if he get the victory, he shall receive the thing that Isay.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	59	For this is the life whereof Moses spake unto the peoplewhile he lived, saying, Choose thee life, that thou mayest live.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	60	Nevertheless they believed not him, nor yet the prophetsafter him, no nor me which have spoken unto them,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	61	That there should not be such heaviness in their destruction,as shall be joy over them that are persuaded to salvation.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	62	I answered then, and said, I know, Lord, that the most Highis called merciful, in that he hath mercy upon them which arenot yet come into the world,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	63	And upon those also that turn to his law;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	64	And that he is patient, and long suffereth those that havesinned, as his creatures;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	65	And that he is bountiful, for he is ready to give where itneedeth;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	66	And that he is of great mercy, for he multiplieth more andmore mercies to them that are present, and that are past, andalso to them which are to come.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	67	For if he shall not multiply his mercies, the world would notcontinue with them that inherit therein.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	68	And he pardoneth; for if he did not so of his goodness, thatthey which have committed iniquities might be eased of them, theten thousandth part of men should not remain living.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	69	And being judge, if he should not forgive them that are curedwith his word, and put out the multitude of contentions,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	7	70	There should be very few left peradventure in an innumerablemultitude.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	1	And he answered me, saying, The most High hath made thisworld for many, but the world to come for few.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	2	I will tell thee a similitude, Esdras; As when thou askestthe earth, it shall say unto thee, that it giveth much mouldwhereof earthen vessels are made, but little dust that goldcometh of: even so is the course of this present world.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	3	There be many created, but few shall be saved.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	4	So answered I and said, Swallow then down, O my soul,understanding, and devour wisdom.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	5	For thou hast agreed to give ear, and art willing toprophesy: for thou hast no longer space than only to live.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	6	O Lord, if thou suffer not thy servant, that we may praybefore thee, and thou give us seed unto our heart, and cultureto our understanding, that there may come fruit of it; how shalleach man live that is corrupt, who beareth the place of a man?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	7	For thou art alone, and we all one workmanship of thinehands, like as thou hast said.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	8	For when the body is fashioned now in the mother's womb, andthou givest it members, thy creature is preserved in fire andwater, and nine months doth thy workmanship endure thy creaturewhich is created in her.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	9	But that which keepeth and is kept shall both be preserved:and when the time cometh, the womb preserved delivereth up thethings that grew in it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	10	For thou hast commanded out of the parts of the body, that isto say, out of the breasts, milk to be given, which is the fruitof the breasts,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	11	That the thing which is fashioned may be nourished for atime, till thou disposest it to thy mercy.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	12	Thou broughtest it up with thy righteousness, and nurturedstit in thy law, and reformedst it with thy judgment.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	13	And thou shalt mortify it as thy creature, and quicken it asthy work.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	14	If therefore thou shalt destroy him which with so greatlabour was fashioned, it is an easy thing to be ordained by thycommandment, that the thing which was made might be preserved.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	15	Now therefore, Lord, I will speak; touching man in general,thou knowest best; but touching thy people, for whose sake I amsorry;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	16	And for thine inheritance, for whose cause I mourn; and forIsrael, for whom I am heavy; and for Jacob, for whose sake I amtroubled;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	17	Therefore will I begin to pray before thee for myself and forthem: for I see the falls of us that dwell in the land.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	18	But I have heard the swiftness of the judge which is to come.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	19	Therefore hear my voice, and understand my words, and I shallspeak before thee. This is the beginning of the words of Esdras,before he was taken up: and I said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	20	O Lord, thou that dwellest in everlastingness which beholdestfrom above things in the heaven and in the air;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	21	Whose throne is inestimable; whose glory may not becomprehended; before whom the hosts of angels stand withtrembling,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	22	Whose service is conversant in wind and fire; whose word istrue, and sayings constant; whose commandment is strong, andordinance fearful;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	23	Whose look drieth up the depths, and indignation maketh themountains to melt away; which the truth witnesseth:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	24	O hear the prayer of thy servant, and give ear to thepetition of thy creature.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	25	For while I live I will speak, and so long as I haveunderstanding I will answer.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	26	O look not upon the sins of thy people; but on them whichserve thee in truth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	27	Regard not the wicked inventions of the heathen, but thedesire of those that keep thy testimonies in afflictions.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	28	Think not upon those that have walked feignedly before thee:but remember them, which according to thy will have known thyfear.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	29	Let it not be thy will to destroy them which have lived likebeasts; but to look upon them that have clearly taught thy law.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	30	Take thou no indignation at them which are deemed worse thanbeasts; but love them that always put their trust in thyrighteousness and glory.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	31	For we and our fathers do languish of such diseases: butbecause of us sinners thou shalt be called merciful.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	32	For if thou hast a desire to have mercy upon us, thou shaltbe called merciful, to us namely, that have no works ofrighteousness.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	33	For the just, which have many good works laid up with thee,shall out of their own deeds receive reward.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	34	For what is man, that thou shouldest take displeasure at him?or what is a corruptible generation, that thou shouldest be sobitter toward it?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	35	For in truth them is no man among them that be born, but hehath dealt wickedly; and among the faithful there is none whichhath not done amiss.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	36	For in this, O Lord, thy righteousness and thy goodness shallbe declared, if thou be merciful unto them which have not theconfidence of good works.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	37	Then answered he me, and said, Some things hast thou spokenaright, and according unto thy words it shall be.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	38	For indeed I will not think on the disposition of them whichhave sinned before death, before judgment, before destruction:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	39	But I will rejoice over the disposition of the righteous, andI will remember also their pilgrimage, and the salvation, andthe reward, that they shall have.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	40	Like as I have spoken now, so shall it come to pass.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	41	For as the husbandman soweth much seed upon the ground, andplanteth many trees, and yet the thing that is sown good in hisseason cometh not up, neither doth all that is planted takeroot: even so is it of them that are sown in the world; theyshall not all be saved.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	42	I answered then and said, If I have found grace, let mespeak.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	43	Like as the husbandman's seed perisheth, if it come not up,and receive not thy rain in due season; or if there come toomuch rain, and corrupt it:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	44	Even so perisheth man also, which is formed with thy hands,and is called thine own image, because thou art like unto him,for whose sake thou hast made all things, and likened him untothe husbandman's seed.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	45	Be not wroth with us but spare thy people, and have mercyupon thine own inheritance: for thou art merciful unto thycreature.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	46	Then answered he me, and said, Things present are for thepresent, and things to cometh for such as be to come.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	47	For thou comest far short that thou shouldest be able to lovemy creature more than I: but I have ofttimes drawn nigh untothee, and unto it, but never to the unrighteous.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	48	In this also thou art marvellous before the most High:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	49	In that thou hast humbled thyself, as it becometh thee, andhast not judged thyself worthy to be much glorified among therighteous.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	50	For many great miseries shall be done to them that in thelatter time shall dwell in the world, because they have walkedin great pride.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	51	But understand thou for thyself, and seek out the glory forsuch as be like thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	52	For unto you is paradise opened, the tree of life is planted,the time to come is prepared, plenteousness is made ready, acity is builded, and rest is allowed, yea, perfect goodness andwisdom.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	53	The root of evil is sealed up from you, weakness and the mothis hid from you, and corruption is fled into hell to beforgotten:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	54	Sorrows are passed, and in the end is shewed the treasure ofimmortality.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	55	And therefore ask thou no more questions concerning themultitude of them that perish.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	56	For when they had taken liberty, they despised the most High,thought scorn of his law, and forsook his ways.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	57	Moreover they have trodden down his righteous,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	58	And said in their heart, that there is no God; yea, and thatknowing they must die.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	59	For as the things aforesaid shalt receive you, so thirst andpain are prepared for them: for it was not his will that menshould come to nought:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	60	But they which be created have defiled the name of him thatmade them, and were unthankful unto him which prepared life forthem.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	61	And therefore is my judgment now at hand.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	62	These things have I not shewed unto all men, but unto thee,and a few like thee. Then answered I and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	8	63	Behold, O Lord, now hast thou shewed me the multitude of thewonders, which thou wilt begin to do in the last times: but atwhat time, thou hast not shewed me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	1	He answered me then, and said, Measure thou the timediligently in itself: and when thou seest part of the signspast, which I have told thee before,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	2	Then shalt thou understand, that it is the very same time,wherein the Highest will begin to visit the world which he made.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	3	Therefore when there shall be seen earthquakes and uproars ofthe people in the world:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	4	Then shalt thou well understand, that the most High spake ofthose things from the days that were before thee, even from thebeginning.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	5	For like as all that is made in the world hath a beginningand an end, and the end is manifest:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	6	Even so the times also of the Highest have plain beginningsin wonder and powerful works, and endings in effects and signs.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	7	And every one that shall be saved, and shall be able toescape by his works, and by faith, whereby ye have believed,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	8	Shall be preserved from the said perils, and shall see mysalvation in my land, and within my borders: for I havesanctified them for me from the beginning.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	9	Then shall they be in pitiful case, which now have abused myways: and they that have cast them away despitefully shall dwellin torments.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	10	For such as in their life have received benefits, and havenot known me;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	11	And they that have loathed my law, while they had yet liberty,and, when as yet place of repentance was open unto them,understood not, but despised it;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	12	The same must know it after death by pain.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	13	And therefore be thou not curious how the ungodly shall bepunished, and when: but enquire how the righteous shall besaved, whose the world is, and for whom the world is created.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	14	Then answered I and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	15	I have said before, and now do speak, and will speak it alsohereafter, that there be many more of them which perish, than ofthem which shall be saved:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	16	Like as a wave is greater than a drop.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	17	And he answered me, saying, Like as the field is, so is alsothe seed; as the flowers be, such are the colours also; such asthe workman is, such also is the work; and as the husbandman lshimself, so is his husbandry also: for it was the time of theworld.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	18	And now when I prepared the world, which was not yet made,even for them to dwell in that now live, no man spake againstme.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	19	For then every one obeyed: but now the manners of them whichare created in this world that is made are corrupted by aperpetual seed, and by a law which is unsearchable ridthemselves.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	20	So I considered the world, and, behold, there was perilbecause of the devices that were come into it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	21	And I saw, and spared it greatly, and have kept me a grape ofthe cluster, and a plant of a great people.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	22	Let the multitude perish then, which was born in vain; andlet my grape be kept, and my plant; for with great labour have Imade it perfect.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	23	Nevertheless, if thou wilt cease yet seven days more, (butthou shalt not fast in them,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	24	But go into a field of flowers, where no house is builded,and eat only the flowers of the field; taste no flesh, drink nowine, but eat flowers only;)
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	25	And pray unto the Highest continually, then will I come andtalk with thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	26	So I went my way into the field which is called Ardath, likeas he commanded me; and there I sat among the flowers, and dideat of the herbs of the field, and the meat of the samesatisfied me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	27	After seven days I sat upon the grass, and my heart was vexedwithin me, like as before:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	28	And I opened my mouth, and began to talk before the mostHigh, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	29	O Lord, thou that shewest thyself unto us, thou wast shewedunto our fathers in the wilderness, in a place where no mantreadeth, in a barren place, when they came out of Egypt.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	30	And thou spakest saying, Hear me, O Israel; and mark mywords, thou seed of Jacob.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	31	For, behold, I sow my law in you, and it shall bring fruit inyou, and ye shall be honoured in it for ever.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	32	But our fathers, which received the law, kept it not, andobserved not thy ordinances: and though the fruit of thy law didnot perish, neither could it, for it was thine;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	33	Yet they that received it perished, because they kept not thething that was sown in them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	34	And, lo, it ls a custom, when the ground hath received seed,or the sea a ship, or any vessel meat or drink, that, that beingperished wherein it was sown or cast into,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	35	That thing also which was sown, or cast therein, or received,doth perish, and remaineth not with us: but with us it hath nothappened so.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	36	For we that have received the law perish by sin, and ourheart also which received it
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	37	Notwithstanding the law perisheth not, but remaineth in hisforce.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	38	And when I spake these things in my heart, I looked back withmine eyes, and upon the right side I saw a woman, and, behold,she mourned and wept with a loud voice, and was much grieved inheart, and her clothes were rent, and she had ashes upon herhead.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	39	Then let I my thoughts go that I was in, and turned me untoher,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	40	And said unto her, Wherefore weepest thou? why art thou sogrieved in thy mind?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	41	And she said unto me, Sir, let me alone, that I may bewailmyself, and add unto my sorrow, for I am sore vexed in my mind,and brought very low.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	42	And I said unto her, What aileth thee? tell me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	43	She said unto me, I thy servant have been barren, and had nochild, though I had an husband thirty years,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	44	And those thirty years I did nothing else day and night, andevery hour, but make my, prayer to the Highest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	45	After thirty years God heard me thine handmaid, looked uponmy misery, considered my trouble, and gave me a son: and I wasvery glad of him, so was my husband also, and all my neighbours:and we gave great honour unto the Almighty.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	46	And I nourished him with great travail.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	9	47	So when he grew up, and came to the time that he should havea wife, I made a feast.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	1	And it so came to pass, that when my son was entered into hiswedding chamber, he fell down, and died.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	2	Then we all overthrew the lights, and all my neighbours roseup to comfort me: so I took my rest unto the second day atnight.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	3	And it came to pass, when they had all left off to comfortme, to the end I might be quiet; then rose I up by night andfled, and came hither into this field, as thou seest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	4	And I do now purpose not to return into the city, but here tostay, and neither to eat nor drink, but continually to mourn andto fast until I die.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	5	Then left I the meditations wherein I was, and spake to herin anger, saying,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	6	Thou foolish woman above all other, seest thou not ourmourning, and what happeneth unto us?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	7	How that Sion our mother is full of all heaviness, and muchhumbled, mourning very sore?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	8	And now, seeing we all mourn and are sad, for we are all inheaviness, art thou grieved for one son?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	9	For ask the earth, and she shall tell thee, that it is shewhich ought to mourn for the fall of so many that grow upon her.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	10	For out of her came all at the first, and out of her shallall others come, and, behold, they walk almost all intodestruction, and a multitude of them is utterly rooted out.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	11	Who then should make more mourning than she, that hath lostso great a multitude; and not thou, which art sorry but for one?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	12	But if thou sayest unto me, My lamentation is not like theearth's, because I have lost the fruit of my womb, which Ibrought forth with pains, and bare with sorrows;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	13	But the earth not so: for the multitude present in itaccording to the course of the earth is gone, as it came:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	14	Then say I unto thee, Like as thou hast brought forth withlabour; even so the earth also hath given her fruit, namely,man, ever since the beginning unto him that made her.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	15	Now therefore keep thy sorrow to thyself, and bear with agood courage that which hath befallen thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	16	For if thou shalt acknowledge the determination of God to bejust, thou shalt both receive thy son in time, and shalt becommended among women.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	17	Go thy way then into the city to thine husband.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	18	And she said unto me, That will I not do: I will not go intothe city, but here will I die.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	19	So I proceeded to speak further unto her, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	20	Do not so, but be counselled. by me: for how many are theadversities of Sion? be comforted in regard of the sorrow ofJerusalem.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	21	For thou seest that our sanctuary is laid waste, our altarbroken down, our temple destroyed;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	22	Our psaltery is laid on the ground, our song is put tosilence, our rejoicing is at an end, the light of ourcandlestick is put out, the ark of our covenant is spoiled, ourholy things are defiled, and the name that is called upon us isalmost profaned: our children are put to shame, our priests areburnt, our Levites are gone into captivity, our virgins aredefiled, and our wives ravished; our righteous men carried away,our little ones destroyed, our young men are brought in bondage,and our strong men are become weak;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	23	And, which is the greatest of all, the seal of Sion hath nowlost her honour; for she is delivered into the hands of themthat hate us.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	24	And therefore shake off thy great heaviness, and put away themultitude of sorrows, that the Mighty may be merciful unto theeagain, and the Highest shall give thee rest and ease from thylabour.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	25	And it came to pass while I was talking with her, behold, herface upon a sudden shined exceedingly, and her countenanceglistered, so that I was afraid of her, and mused what it mightbe.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	26	And, behold, suddenly she made a great cry very fearful: sothat the earth shook at the noise of the woman.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	27	And I looked, and, behold, the woman appeared unto me nomore, but there was a city builded, and a large place sheweditself from the foundations: then was I afraid, and cried with aloud voice, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	28	Where is Uriel the angel, who came unto me at the first? forhe hath caused me to fall into many trances, and mine end isturned into corruption, and my prayer to rebuke.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	29	And as I was speaking these words behold, he came unto me,and looked upon me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	30	And, lo, I lay as one that had been dead, and mineunderstanding was taken from me: and he took me by the righthand, and comforted me, and set me upon my feet, and said untome,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	31	What aileth thee? and why art thou so disquieted? and why isthine understanding troubled, and the thoughts of thine heart?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	32	And I said, Because thou hast forsaken me, and yet I didaccording to thy words, and I went into the field, and, lo, Ihave seen, and yet see, that I am not able to express.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	33	And he said unto me, Stand up manfully, and I will advisethee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	34	Then said I, Speak on, my lord, in me; only forsake me not,lest I die frustrate of my hope.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	35	For I have seen that I knew not, and hear that I do not know.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	36	Or is my sense deceived, or my soul in a dream?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	37	Now therefore I beseech thee that thou wilt shew thy servantof this vision.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	38	He answered me then, and said, Hear me, and I shall informthee, and tell thee wherefore thou art afraid: for the Highestwill reveal many secret things unto thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	39	He hath seen that thy way is right: for that thou sorrowestcontinually for thy people, and makest great lamentation forSion.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	40	This therefore is the meaning of the vision which thou latelysawest:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	41	Thou sawest a woman mourning, and thou begannest to comforther:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	42	But now seest thou the likeness of the woman no more, butthere appeared unto thee a city builded.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	43	And whereas she told thee of the death of her son, this isthe solution:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	44	This woman, whom thou sawest is Sion: and whereas she saidunto thee, even she whom thou seest as a city builded,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	45	Whereas, I say, she said unto thee, that she hath been thirtyyears barren: those are the thirty years wherein there was nooffering made in her.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	46	But after thirty years Solomon builded the city and offeredofferings: and then bare the barren a son.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	47	And whereas she told thee that she nourished him with labour:that was the dwelling in Jerusalem.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	48	But whereas she said unto thee, That my son coming into hismarriage chamber happened to have a fail, and died: this was thedestruction that came to Jerusalem.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	49	And, behold, thou sawest her likeness, and because shemourned for her son, thou begannest to comfort her: and of thesethings which have chanced, these are to be opened unto thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	50	For now the most High seeth that thou art grievedunfeignedly, and sufferest from thy whole heart for her, so hathhe shewed thee the brightness of her glory, and the comelinessof her beauty:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	51	And therefore I bade thee remain in the field where no housewas builded:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	52	For I knew that the Highest would shew this unto thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	53	Therefore I commanded thee to go into the field, where nofoundation of any building was.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	54	For in the place wherein the Highest beginneth to shew hiscity, there can no man's building be able to stand.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	55	And therefore fear not, let not thine heart be affrighted,but go thy way in, and see the beauty and greatness of thebuilding, as much as thine eyes be able to see:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	56	And then shalt thou hear as much as thine ears maycomprehend.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	57	For thou art blessed above many other, and art called withthe Highest; and so are but few.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	58	But to morrow at night thou shalt remain here;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	10	59	And so shall the Highest shew thee visions of the highthings, which the most High will do unto them that dwell uponthe earth in the last days. So I slept that night and another,like as he commanded me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	1	Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the seaan eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	2	And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all theearth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and weregathered together.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	3	And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew othercontrary feathers; and they became little feathers and small.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	4	But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greaterthan the other, yet rested it with the residue.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	5	Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers,and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	6	And I saw that all things under heaven were subject unto her,and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	7	And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, andspake to her feathers, saying,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	8	Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, andwatch by course:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	9	But let the heads be preserved for the last.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	10	And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads,but from the midst of her body.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	11	And I numbered her contrary feathers, and, behold, there wereeight of them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	12	And I looked, and, behold, on the right side there arose onefeather, and reigned over all the earth;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	13	And so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, andthe place thereof appeared no more: so the next following stoodup. and reigned, and had a great time;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	14	And it happened, that when it reigned, the end of it camealso, like as the first, so that it appeared no more.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	15	Then came there a voice unto it, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	16	Hear thou that hast borne rule over the earth so long: this Isay unto thee, before thou beginnest to appear no more,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	17	There shall none after thee attain unto thy time, neitherunto the half thereof.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	18	Then arose the third, and reigned as the other before, andappeared no more also.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	19	So went it with all the residue one after another, as thatevery one reigned, and then appeared no more.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	20	Then I beheld, and, lo, in process of time the feathers thatfollowed stood up upon the right side, that they might rulealso; and some of them ruled, but within a while they appearedno more:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	21	For some of them were set up, but ruled not.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	22	After this I looked, and, behold, the twelve feathersappeared no more, nor the two little feathers:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	23	And there was no more upon the eagle's body, but three headsthat rested, and six little wings.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	24	Then saw I also that two little feathers divided themselvesfrom the six, and remained under the head that was upon theright side: for the four continued in their place.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	25	And I beheld, and, lo, the feathers that were under the wingthought to set up themselves and to have the rule.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	26	And I beheld, and, lo, there was one set up, but shortly itappeared no more.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	27	And the second was sooner away than the first.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	28	And I beheld, and, lo, the two that remained thought also inthemselves to reign:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	29	And when they so thought, behold, there awaked one of theheads that were at rest, namely, it that was in the midst; forthat was greater than the two other heads.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	30	And then I saw that the two other heads were joined with it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	31	And, behold, the head was turned with them that were with it,and did eat up the two feathers under the wing that would havereigned.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	32	But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bare rule init over all those that dwelt upon the earth with muchoppression; and it had the governance of the world more than allthe wings that had been.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	33	And after this I beheld, and, lo, the head that was in themidst suddenly appeared no more, like as the wings.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	34	But there remained the two heads, which also in like sortruled upon the earth, and over those that dwelt therein.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	35	And I beheld, and, lo, the head upon the right side devouredit that was upon the left side.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	36	Then I head a voice, which said unto me, Look before thee,and consider the thing that thou seest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	37	And I beheld, and lo, as it were a roaring lion chased out ofthe wood: and I saw that he sent out a man's voice unto theeagle, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	38	Hear thou, I will talk with thee, and the Highest shall sayunto thee,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	39	Art not thou it that remainest of the four beasts, whom Imade to reign in my world, that the end of their times mightcome through them?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	40	And the fourth came, and overcame all the beasts that werepast, and had power over the world with great fearfulness, andover the whole compass of the earth with much wicked oppression;and so long time dwelt he upon the earth with deceit.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	41	For the earth hast thou not judged with truth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	42	For thou hast afflicted the meek, thou hast hurt thepeaceable, thou hast loved liars, and destroyed the dwellings ofthem that brought forth fruit, and hast cast down the walls ofsuch as did thee no harm.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	43	Therefore is thy wrongful dealing come up unto the Highest,and thy pride unto the Mighty.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	44	The Highest also hath looked upon the proud times, and,behold, they are ended, and his abominations are fulfilled.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	45	And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horriblewings, nor thy wicked feathers nor thy malicious heads, nor thyhurtful claws, nor all thy vain body:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	11	46	That all the earth may be refreshed, and may return, beingdelivered from thy violence, and that she may hope for thejudgment and mercy of him that made her.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	1	And it came to pass, whiles the lion spake these words untothe eagle, I saw,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	2	And, behold, the head that remained and the four wingsappeared no more, and the two went unto it and set themselves upto reign, and their kingdom was small, and fill of uproar.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	3	And I saw, and, behold, they appeared no more, and the wholebody of the eagle was burnt so that the earth was in great fear:then awaked I out of the trouble and trance of my mind, and fromgreat fear, and said unto my spirit,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	4	Lo, this hast thou done unto me, in that thou searchest outthe ways of the Highest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	5	Lo, yet am I weary in my mind, and very weak in my spirit;and little strength is there in me, for the great fear wherewithI was afflicted this night.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	6	Therefore will I now beseech the Highest, that he willcomfort me unto the end.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	7	And I said, Lord that bearest rule, if I have found gracebefore thy sight, and if I am justified with thee before manyothers, and if my prayer indeed be come up before thy face;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	8	Comfort me then, and shew me thy servant the interpretationand plain difference of this fearful vision, that thou mayestperfectly comfort my soul.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	9	For thou hast judged me worthy to shew me the last times.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	10	And he said unto me, This is the interpretation of thevision:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	11	The eagle, whom thou sawest come up from the sea, is thekingdom which was seen in the vision of thy brother Daniel.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	12	But it was not expounded unto him, therefore now I declare itunto thee.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	13	Behold, the days will come, that there shall rise up akingdom upon earth, and it shall be feared above all thekingdoms that were before it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	14	In the same shall twelve kings reign, one after another:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	15	Whereof the second shall begin to reign, and shall have moretime than any of the twelve.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	16	And this do the twelve wings signify, which thou sawest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	17	As for the voice which thou heardest speak, and that thousawest not to go out from the heads but from the midst of thebody thereof, this is the interpretation:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	18	That after the time of that kingdom there shall arise greatstrivings, and it shall stand in peril of failing: neverthelessit shall not then fall, but shall be restored again to hisbeginning.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	19	And whereas thou sawest the eight small under featherssticking to her wings, this is the interpretation:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	20	That in him there shall arise eight kings, whose times shallbe but small, and their years swift.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	21	And two of them shall perish, the middle time approaching:four shall be kept until their end begin to approach: but twoshall be kept unto the end.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	22	And whereas thou sawest three heads resting, this is theinterpretation:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	23	In his last days shall the most High raise up three kingdoms,and renew many things therein, and they shall have the dominionof the earth,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	24	And of those that dwell therein, with much oppression, aboveall those that were before them: therefore are they called theheads of the eagle.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	25	For these are they that shall accomplish his wickedness, andthat shall finish his last end.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	26	And whereas thou sawest that the great head appeared no more,it signifieth that one of them shall die upon his bed, and yetwith pain.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	27	For the two that remain shall be slain with the sword.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	28	For the sword of the one shall devour the other: but at thelast shall he fall through the sword himself.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	29	And whereas thou sawest two feathers under the wings passingover the head that is on the right side;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	30	It signifieth that these are they, whom the Highest hath keptunto their end: this is the small kingdom and full of trouble,as thou sawest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	31	And the lion, whom thou sawest rising up out of the wood, androaring, and speaking to the eagle, and rebuking her for herunrighteousness with all the words which thou hast heard;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	32	This is the anointed, which the Highest hath kept for themand for their wickedness unto the end: he shall reprove them,and shall upbraid them with their cruelty.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	33	For he shall set them before him alive in judgment, and shallrebuke them, and correct them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	34	For the rest of my people shall he deliver with mercy, thosethat have been pressed upon my borders, and he shall make themjoyful until the coming of the day of judgment, whereof I havespoken unto thee from the the beginning.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	35	This is the dream that thou sawest, and these are theinterpretations.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	36	Thou only hast been meet to know this secret of the Highest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	37	Therefore write all these things that thou hast seen in abook, and hide them:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	38	And teach them to the wise of the people, whose hearts thouknowest may comprehend and keep these secrets.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	39	But wait thou here thyself yet seven days more, that it maybe shewed thee, whatsoever it pleaseth the Highest to declareunto thee. And with that he went his way.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	40	And it came to pass, when all the people saw that the sevendays were past, and I not come again into the city, theygathered them all together, from the least unto the greatest,and came unto me, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	41	What have we offended thee? and what evil have we doneagainst thee, that thou forsakest us, and sittest here in thisplace?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	42	For of all the prophets thou only art left us, as a clusterof the vintage, and as a candle in a dark place, and as a havenor ship preserved from the tempest.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	43	Are not the evils which are come to us sufficient?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	44	If thou shalt forsake us, how much better had it been for us,if we also had been burned in the midst of Sion?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	45	For we are not better than they that died there. And theywept with a loud voice. Then answered I them, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	46	Be of good comfort, O Israel; and be not heavy, thou house ofJacob:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	47	For the Highest hath you in remembrance, and the Mighty hathnot forgotten you in temptation.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	48	As for me, I have not forsaken you, neither am I departedfrom you: but am come into this place, to pray for thedesolation of Sion, and that I might seek mercy for the lowestate of your sanctuary.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	49	And now go your way home every man, and after these days willI come unto you.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	50	So the people went their way into the city, like as Icommanded them:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	12	51	But I remained still in the field seven days, as the angelcommanded me; and did eat only in those days of the flowers ofthe field, and had my meat of the herbs
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	1	And it came to pass after seven days, I dreamed a dream bynight:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	2	And, lo, there arose a wind from the sea, that it moved allthe waves thereof.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	3	And I beheld, and, lo, that man waxed strong with thethousands of heaven: and when he turned his countenance to look,all the things trembled that were seen under him.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	4	And whensoever the voice went out of his mouth, all theyburned that heard his voice, like as the earth faileth when itfeeleth the fire.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	5	And after this I beheld, and, lo, there was gathered togethera multitude of men, out of number, from the four winds of theheaven, to subdue the man that came out of the sea
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	6	But I beheld, and, lo, he had graved himself a greatmountain, and flew up upon it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	7	But I would have seen the region or place whereout the hillwas graven, and I could not.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	8	And after this I beheld, and, lo, all they which weregathered together to subdue him were sore afraid, and yet durstfight.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	9	And, lo, as he saw the violence of the multitude that came,he neither lifted up his hand, nor held sword, nor anyinstrument of war:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	10	But only I saw that he sent out of his mouth as it had been ablast of fire, and out of his lips a flaming breath, and out ofhis tongue he cast out sparks and tempests.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	11	And they were all mixed together; the blast of fire, theflaming breath, and the great tempest; and fell with violenceupon the multitude which was prepared to fight, and burned themup every one, so that upon a sudden of an innumerable multitudenothing was to be perceived, but only dust and smell of smoke:when I saw this I was afraid.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	12	Afterward saw I the same man come down from the mountain, andcall unto him another peaceable Multitude.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	13	And there came much people unto him, whereof some were glad,some were sorry, and some of them were bound, and other somebrought of them that were offered: then was I sick through greatfear, and I awaked, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	14	Thou hast shewed thy servant these wonders from thebeginning, and hast counted me worthy that thou shouldestreceive my prayer:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	15	Shew me now yet the interpretation of this dream.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	16	For as I conceive in mine understanding, woe unto them thatshall be left in those days and much more woe unto them that arenot left behind!
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	17	For they that were not left were in heaviness.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	18	Now understand I the things that are laid up in the latterdays, which shall happen unto them, and to those that are leftbehind.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	19	Therefore are they come into great perils and manynecessities, like as these dreams declare.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	20	Yet is it easier for him that is in danger to come into thesethings, than to pass away as a cloud out of the world, and notto see the things that happen in the last days. And he answeredunto me, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	21	The interpretation of the vision shall I shew thee, and Iwill open unto thee the thing that thou hast required.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	22	Whereas thou hast spoken of them that are left behind, thisis the interpretation:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	23	He that shall endure the peril in that time hath kepthimself: they that be fallen into danger are such as have works,and faith toward the Almighty.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	24	Know this therefore, that they which be left behind are moreblessed than they that be dead.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	25	This is the meaning of the vision: Whereas thou sawest a mancoming up from the midst of the sea:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	26	The same is he whom God the Highest hath kept a great season,which by his own self shall deliver his creature: and he shallorder them that are left behind.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	27	And whereas thou sawest, that out of his mouth there came asa blast of wind, and fire, and storm;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	28	And that he held neither sword, nor any instrument of war,but that the rushing in of him destroyed the whole multitudethat came to subdue him; this is the interpretation:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	29	Behold, the days come, when the most High will begin todeliver them that are upon the earth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	30	And he shall come to the astonishment of them that dwell onthe earth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	31	And one shall undertake to fight against another, one cityagainst another, one place against another, one people againstanother, and one realm against another.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	32	And the time shall be when these things shall come to pass,and the signs shall happen which I shewed thee before, and thenshall my Son be declared, whom thou sawest as a man ascending.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	33	And when all the people hear his voice, every man shall intheir own land leave the battle they have one against another.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	34	And an innumerable multitude shall be gathered together, asthou sawest them, willing to come, and to overcome him byfighting.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	35	But he shall stand upon the top of the mount Sion.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	36	And Sion shall come, and shall be shewed to all men, beingprepared and builded, like as thou sawest the hill gravenwithout hands.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	37	And this my Son shall rebuke the wicked inventions of thosenations, which for their wicked life are fallen into thetempest;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	38	And shall lay before them their evil thoughts, and thetorments wherewith they shall begin to be tormented, which arelike unto a flame: and he shall destroy them without labour bythe law which is like unto me.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	39	And whereas thou sawest that he gathered another peaceablemultitude unto him;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	40	Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisonersout of their own land in the time of Osea the king, whomSalmanasar the king of Assyria led away captive, and he carriedthem over the waters, and so came they into another land.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	41	But they took this counsel among themselves, that they wouldleave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into a furthercountry, where never mankind dwelt,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	42	That they might there keep their statutes, which they neverkept in their own land.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	43	And they entered into Euphrates by the narrow places of theriver.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	44	For the most High then shewed signs for them, and held stillthe flood, till they were passed over.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	45	For through that country there was a great way to go, namely,of a year and a half: and the same region is called Arsareth.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	46	Then dwelt they there until the latter time; and now whenthey shall begin to come,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	47	The Highest shall stay the springs of the stream again, thatthey may go through: therefore sawest thou the multitude withpeace.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	48	But those that be left behind of thy people are they that arefound within my borders.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	49	Now when he destroyeth the multitude of the nations that aregathered together, he shall defend his people that remain.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	50	And then shall he shew them great wonders.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	51	Then said I, O Lord that bearest rule, shew me this:Wherefore have I seen the man coming up from the midst of thesea?
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	52	And he said unto me, Like as thou canst neither seek out norknow the things that are in the deep of the sea: even so can noman upon earth see my Son, or those that be with him, but in theday time.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	53	This is the interpretation of the dream which thou sawest,and whereby thou only art here lightened.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	54	For thou hast forsaken thine own way, and applied thydiligence unto my law, and sought it.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	55	Thy life hast thou ordered in wisdom, and hast calledunderstanding thy mother.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	56	And therefore have I shewed thee the treasures of theHighest: after other three days I will speak other things untothee, and declare unto thee mighty and wondrous things.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	57	Then went I forth into the field, giving praise and thanksgreatly unto the most High because of his wonders which he didin time;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	13	58	And because he governeth the same, and such things as fall intheir seasons: and there I sat three days.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	1	And it came to pass upon the third day, I sat under an oak,and, behold, there came a voice out of a bush over against me,and said, Esdras, Esdras.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	2	And I said, Here am I, Lord And I stood up upon my feet.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	3	Then said he unto me, In the bush I did manifestly revealmyself unto Moses, and talked with him, when my people served inEgypt:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	4	And I sent him and led my people out of Egypt, and broughthim up to the mount of where I held him by me a long season,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	5	And told him many wondrous things, and shewed him the secretsof the times, and the end; and commanded him, saying,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	6	These words shalt thou declare, and these shalt thou hide.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	7	And now I say unto thee,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	8	That thou lay up in thy heart the signs that I have shewed,and the dreams that thou hast seen, and the interpretationswhich thou hast heard:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	9	For thou shalt be taken away from all, and from henceforththou shalt remain with my Son, and with such as be like thee,until the times be ended.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	10	For the world hath lost his youth, and the times begin to waxold.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	11	For the world is divided into twelve parts, and the ten partsof it are gone already, and half of a tenth part:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	12	And there remaineth that which is after the half of the tenthpart.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	13	Now therefore set thine house in order, and reprove thypeople, comfort such of them as be in trouble, and now renouncecorruption,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	14	Let go from thee mortal thoughts, cast away the burdens ofman, put off now the weak nature,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	15	And set aside the thoughts that are most heavy unto thee, andhaste thee to flee from these times.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	16	For yet greater evils than those which thou hast seen happenshall be done hereafter.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	17	For look how much the world shall be weaker through age, somuch the more shall evils increase upon them that dwell therein.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	18	For the time is fled far away, and leasing is hard at hand:for now hasteth the vision to come, which thou hast seen.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	19	Then answered I before thee, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	20	Behold, Lord, I will go, as thou hast commanded me, andreprove the people which are present: but they that shall beborn afterward, who shall admonish them? thus the world is setin darkness, and they that dwell therein are without light.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	21	For thy law is burnt, therefore no man knoweth the thingsthat are done of thee, or the work that shall begin.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	22	But if I have found grace before thee, send the Holy Ghostinto me, and I shall write all that hath been done in the worldsince the beginning, which were written in thy law, that men mayfind thy path, and that they which will live in the latter daysmay live.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	23	And he answered me, saying, Go thy way, gather the peopletogether, and say unto them, that they seek thee not for fortydays.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	24	But look thou prepare thee many box trees, and take with theeSarea, Dabria, Selemia, Ecanus, and Asiel, these five which areready to write swiftly;
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	25	And come hither, and I shall light a candle of understandingin thine heart, which shall not be put out, till the things beperformed which thou shalt begin to write.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	26	And when thou hast done, some things shalt thou publish, andsome things shalt thou shew secretly to the wise: to morrow thishour shalt thou begin to write.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	27	Then went I forth, as he commanded, and gathered all thepeople together, and said,
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	28	Hear these words, O Israel.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	29	Our fathers at the beginning were strangers in Egypt, fromwhence they were delivered:
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	30	And received the law of life, which they kept not, which yealso have transgressed after them.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	31	Then was the land, even the land of Sion, parted among you bylot: but your fathers, and ye yourselves, have doneunrighteousness, and have not kept the ways which the Highestcommanded you.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	32	And forasmuch as he is a righteous judge, he took from you intime the thing that he had given you.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	33	And now are ye here, and your brethren among you.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	34	Therefore if so be that ye will subdue your ownunderstanding, and reform your hearts, ye shall be kept aliveand after death ye shall obtain mercy.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	35	For after death shall the judgment come, when we shall liveagain: and then shall the names of the righteous be manifest,and the works of the ungodly shall be declared.
The Second book of Esdras	2Esdr	14	36	Let no man therefore come unto me now, nor seek after methese forty days.

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	1	The copy of the letters was this: The great king Artexerxeswriteth these things to the princes and governours that are underhim from India unto Ethiopia in an hundred and seven and twentyprovinces.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	2	After that I became lord over many nations and had dominionover the whole world, not lifted up with presumption of myauthority, but carrying myself always with equity and mildness,I purposed to settle my subjects continually in a quiet life,and making my kingdom peaceable, and open for passage to theutmost coasts, to renew peace, which is desired of all men.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	3	Now when I asked my counsellors how this might be brought topass, Aman, that excelled in wisdom among us, and was approvedfor his constant good will and steadfast fidelity, and had thehonour of the second place in the kingdom,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	4	Declared unto us, that in all nations throughout the worldthere was scattered a certain malicious people, that had lawscontrary to ail nations, and continually despised thecommandments of kings, so as the uniting of our kingdoms,honourably intended by us cannot go forward.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	5	Seeing then we understand that this people alone iscontinually in opposition unto all men, differing in the strangemanner of their laws, and evil affected to our state, workingall the mischief they can that our kingdom may not be firmlyestablished:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	6	Therefore have we commanded, that all they that are signifiedin writing unto you by Aman, who is ordained over the affairs,and is next unto us, shall all, with their wives and children,be utterly destroyed by the sword of their enemies, without allmercy and pity, the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar ofthis present year:

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	8	Then Mardocheus thought upon all the works of the Lord, andmade his prayer unto him,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	9	Saying, O Lord, Lord, the King Almighty: for the whole worldis in thy power, and if thou hast appointed to save Israel,there is no man that can gainsay thee:

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	12	Thou knowest all things, and thou knowest, Lord, that it wasneither in contempt nor pride, nor for any desire of glory, thatI did not bow down to proud Aman.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	13	For I could have been content with good will for thesalvation of Israel to kiss the soles of his feet.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	14	But I did this, that I might not prefer the glory of manabove the glory of God: neither will I worship any but thee, OGod, neither will I do it in pride.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	15	And now, O Lord God and King, spare thy people: for theireyes are upon us to bring us to nought; yea, they desire todestroy the inheritance, that hath been thine from thebeginning.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	16	Despise not the portion, which thou hast delivered out ofEgypt for thine own self.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	13	17	Hear my prayer, and be merciful unto thine inheritance: turnour sorrow into joy, that we may live, O Lord, and praise thyname: and destroy not the mouths of them that praise thee, OLord.

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	1	Queen Esther also, being in fear of death, resorted unto theLord:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	2	And laid away her glorious apparel, and put on the garmentsof anguish and mourning: and instead of precious ointments, shecovered her head with ashes and dung, and she humbled her bodygreatly, and all the places of her joy she filled with her tornhair.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	3	And she prayed unto the Lord God of Israel, saying, O myLord, thou only art our King: help me, desolate woman, whichhave no helper but thee:

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	5	From my youth up I have heard in the tribe of my family thatthou, O Lord, tookest Israel from among all people, and ourfathers from all their predecessors, for a perpetualinheritance, and thou hast performed whatsoever thou didstpromise them.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	6	And now we have sinned before thee: therefore hast thou givenus into the hands of our enemies,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	7	Because we worshipped their gods: O Lord, thou art righteous.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	8	Nevertheless it satisfieth them not, that we are in bittercaptivity: but they have stricken hands with their idols,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	9	That they will abolish the thing that thou with thy mouthhast ordained, and destroy thine inheritance, and stop the mouthof them that praise thee, and quench the glory of thy house, andof thine altar,

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	11	O Lord, give not thy sceptre unto them that be nothing, andlet them not laugh at our fall; but turn their device uponthemselves, and make him an example, that hath begun thisagainst us.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	12	Remember, O Lord, make thyself known in time of ouraffliction, and give me boldness, O King of the nations, andLord of all power.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	13	Give me eloquent speech in my mouth before the lion: turn hisheart to hate him that fighteth against us, that there may be anend of him, and of all that are likeminded to him:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	14	But deliver us with thine hand, and help me that am desolate,and which have no other help but thee.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	15	Thou knowest all things, O Lord; thou knowest that I hate theglory of the unrighteous, and abhor the bed of theuncircumcised, and of all the heathen.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	16	Thou knowest my necessity: for I abhor the sign of my highestate, which is upon mine head in the days wherein I shewmyself, and that I abhor it as a menstruous rag, and that I wearit not when I am private by myself.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	14	17	And that thine handmaid hath not eaten at Aman's table, andthat I have not greatly esteemed the king's feast, nor drunk thewine of the drink offerings.

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	4	And the other followed, bearing up her train.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	5	And she was ruddy through the perfection of her beauty, andher countenance was cheerful and very amiable: but her heart wasin anguish for fear.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	6	Then having passed through all the doors, she stood beforethe king, who sat upon his royal throne, and was clothed withall his robes of majesty, all glittering with gold and preciousstones; and he was very dreadful.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	7	Then lifting up his countenance that shone with majesty, helooked very fiercely upon her: and the queen fell down, and waspale, and fainted, and bowed herself upon the head of the maidthat went before her.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	8	Then God changed the spirit of the king into mildness, who ina fear leaped from his throne, and took her in his arms, tillshe came to herself again, and comforted her with loving wordsand said unto her,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	9	Esther, what is the matter? I am thy brother, be of goodcheer:

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	13	Then said she unto him, I saw thee, my lord, as an angel ofGod, and my heart was troubled for fear of thy majesty.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	14	For wonderful art thou, lord, and thy countenance is full ofgrace.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	15	15	And as she was speaking, she fell down for faintness.

The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	1	The great king Artexerxes unto the princes and governors ofan hundred and seven and twenty provinces from India untoEthiopia, and unto all our faithful subjects, greeting.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	2	Many, the more often they are honoured with the great bountyof their gracious princes, the more proud they are waxen,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	3	And endeavour to hurt not our subjects only, but not beingable to bear abundance, do take in hand to practise also againstthose that do them good:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	4	And take not only thankfulness away from among men, but alsolifted up with the glorious words of lewd persons, that werenever good, they think to escape the justice of God, that seethall things and hateth evil.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	5	Oftentimes also fair speech of those, that are put in trustto manage their friends' affairs, hath caused many that are inauthority to be partakers of innocent blood, and hath enwrappedthem in remediless calamities:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	6	Beguiling with the falsehood and deceit of their lewddisposition the innocency and goodness of princes.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	7	Now ye may see this, as we have declared, not so much byancient histories, as ye may, if ye search what hath beenwickedly done of late through the pestilent behaviour of themthat are unworthily placed in authority.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	8	And we must take care for the time to come, that our kingdommay be quiet and peaceable for all men,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	9	Both by changing our purposes, and always judging things thatare evident with more equal proceeding.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	10	For Aman, a Macedonian, the son of Amadatha, being indeed astranger from the Persian blood, and far distant from ourgoodness, and as a stranger received of us,
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	11	Had so far forth obtained the favour that we shew towardevery nation, as that he was called our father, and wascontinually honoured of all the next person unto the king.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	12	But he, not bearing his great dignity, went about to depriveus of our kingdom and life:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	13	Having by manifold and cunning deceits sought of us thedestruction, as well of Mardocheus, who saved our life, andcontinually procured our good, as also of blameless Esther,partaker of our kingdom, with their whole nation.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	14	For by these means he thought, finding us destitute offriends to have translated the kingdom of the Persians to theMacedonians.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	15	But we find that the Jews, whom this wicked wretch hathdelivered to utter destruction, are no evildoers, but live bymost just laws:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	16	And that they be children of the most high and most mighty,living God, who hath ordered the kingdom both unto us and to ourprogenitors in the most excellent manner.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	17	Wherefore ye shall do well not to put in execution theletters sent unto you by Aman the son of Amadatha.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	18	For he that was the worker of these things, is hanged at thegates of Susa with all his family: God, who ruleth all things,speedily rendering vengeance to him according to his deserts.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	19	Therefore ye shall publish the copy of this letter in allplaces, that the Jews may freely live after their own laws.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	20	And ye shall aid them, that even the same day, being thethirteenth day of the twelfth month Adar, they may be avenged onthem, who in the time of their affliction shall set upon them.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	21	For Almighty God hath turned to joy unto them the day,wherein the chosen people should have perished.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	22	Ye shall therefore among your solemn feasts keep it an highday with all feasting:
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	23	That both now and hereafter there may be safety to us and thewell affected Persians; but to those which do conspire againstus a memorial of destruction.
The Greek Addition to Esther	AddEsth	16	24	Therefore every city and country whatsoever, which shall notdo according to these things, shall be destroyed without mercywith fire and sword, and shall be made not only unpassable formen, but also most hateful to wild beasts and fowls for ever.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	1	And it happened, after that Alexander son of Philip, theMacedonian, who came out of the land of Chettiim, had smittenDarius king of the Persians and Medes, that he reigned in hisstead, the first over Greece,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	2	And made many wars, and won many strong holds, and slew thekings of the earth,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	3	And went through to the ends of the earth, and took spoils ofmany nations, insomuch that the earth was quiet before him;whereupon he was exalted and his heart was lifted up.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	4	And he gathered a mighty strong host and ruled overcountries, and nations, and kings, who became tributaries untohim.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	5	And after these things he fell sick, and perceived that heshould die.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	6	Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable,and had been brought up with him from his youth, and parted hiskingdom among them, while he was yet alive.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	7	So Alexander reigned twelves years, and then died.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	8	And his servants bare rule every one in his place.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	9	And after his death they all put crowns upon themselves; sodid their sons after them many years: and evils were multipliedin the earth.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	10	And there came out of them a wicked root Antiochus surnamedEpiphanes, son of Antiochus the king, who had been an hostage atRome, and he reigned in the hundred and thirty and seventh yearof the kingdom of the Greeks.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	11	In those days went there out of Israel wicked men, whopersuaded many, saying, Let us go and make a covenant with theheathen that are round about us: for since we departed from themwe have had much sorrow.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	12	So this device pleased them well.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	13	Then certain of the people were so forward herein, that theywent to the king, who gave them licence to do after theordinances of the heathen:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	14	Whereupon they built a place of exercise at Jerusalemaccording to the customs of the heathen:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	15	And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holycovenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold todo mischief.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	16	Now when the kingdom was established before Antiochus, hethought to reign over Egypt that he might have the dominion oftwo realms.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	17	Wherefore he entered into Egypt with a great multitude, withchariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great navy,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	18	And made war against Ptolemee king of Egypt: but Ptolemee wasafraid of him, and fled; and many were wounded to death.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	19	Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt and hetook the spoils thereof.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	20	And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned againin the hundred forty and third year, and went up against Israeland Jerusalem with a great multitude,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	21	And entered proudly into the sanctuary, and took away thegolden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vesselsthereof,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	22	And the table of the shewbread, and the pouring vessels, andthe vials. and the censers of gold, and the veil, and the crown,and the golden ornaments that were before the temple, all whichhe pulled off.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	23	He took also the silver and the gold, and the preciousvessels: also he took the hidden treasures which he found.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	24	And when he had taken all away, he went into his own land,having made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	25	Therefore there was a great mourning in Israel, in everyplace where they were;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	26	So that the princes and elders mourned, the virgins and youngmen were made feeble, and the beauty of women was changed.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	27	Every bridegroom took up lamentation, and she that sat in themarriage chamber was in heaviness,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	28	The land also was moved for the inhabitants thereof, and allthe house of Jacob was covered with confusion.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	29	And after two years fully expired the king sent his chiefcollector of tribute unto the cities of Juda, who came untoJerusalem with a great multitude,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	30	And spake peaceable words unto them, but all was deceit: forwhen they had given him credence, he fell suddenly upon thecity, and smote it very sore, and destroyed much people ofIsrael.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	31	And when he had taken the spoils of the city, he set it onfire, and pulled down the houses and walls thereof on everyside.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	32	But the women and children took they captive, and possessedthe cattle.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	33	Then builded they the city of David with a great and strongwall, and with mighty towers, and made it a strong hold forthem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	34	And they put therein a sinful nation, wicked men, andfortified themselves therein.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	35	They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when theyhad gathered together the spoils of Jerusalem, they laid them upthere, and so they became a sore snare:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	36	For it was a place to lie in wait against the sanctuary, andan evil adversary to Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	37	Thus they shed innocent blood on every side of the sanctuary,and defiled it:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	38	Insomuch that the inhabitants of Jerusalem fled because ofthem: whereupon the city was made an habitation of strangers,and became strange to those that were born in her; and her ownchildren left her.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	39	Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness, her feastswere turned into mourning, her sabbaths into reproach her honourinto contempt.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	40	As had been her glory, so was her dishonour increased, andher excellency was turned into mourning.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	41	Moreover king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdom, that allshould be one people,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	42	And every one should leave his laws: so all the heathenagreed according to the commandment of the king.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	43	Yea, many also of the Israelites consented to his religion,and sacrificed unto idols, and profaned the sabbath.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	44	For the king had sent letters by messengers unto Jerusalemand the cities of Juda that they should follow the strange lawsof the land,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	45	And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drinkofferings, in the temple; and that they should profane thesabbaths and festival days:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	46	And pollute the sanctuary and holy people:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	47	Set up altars, and groves, and chapels of idols, andsacrifice swine's flesh, and unclean beasts:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	48	That they should also leave their children uncircumcised, andmake their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness andprofanation:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	49	To the end they might forget the law, and change all theordinances.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	50	And whosoever would not do according to the commandment ofthe king, he said, he should die.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	51	In the selfsame manner wrote he to his whole kingdom, andappointed overseers over all the people, commanding the citiesof Juda to sacrifice, city by city.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	52	Then many of the people were gathered unto them, to wit everyone that forsook the law; and so they committed evils in theland;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	53	And drove the Israelites into secret places, even wheresoeverthey could flee for succour.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	54	Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the hundredforty and fifth year, they set up the abomination of desolationupon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities ofJuda on every side;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	55	And burnt incense at the doors of their houses, and in thestreets.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	56	And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law whichthey found, they burnt them with fire.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	57	And whosoever was found with any the book of the testament,or if any committed to the law, the king's commandment was, thatthey should put him to death.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	58	Thus did they by their authority unto the Israelites everymonth, to as many as were found in the cities.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	59	Now the five and twentieth day of the month they didsacrifice upon the idol altar, which was upon the altar of God.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	60	At which time according to the commandment they put to deathcertain women, that had caused their children to be circumcised.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	61	And they hanged the infants about their necks, and rifledtheir houses, and slew them that had circumcised them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	62	Howbeit many in Israel were fully resolved and confirmed inthemselves not to eat any unclean thing.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	63	Wherefore the rather to die, that they might not be defiledwith meats, and that they might not profane the holy covenant:so then they died.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	1	64	And there was very great wrath upon Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	1	In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son ofSimeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, anddwelt in Modin.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	2	And he had five sons, Joannan, called Caddis:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	3	Simon; called Thassi:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	4	Judas, who was called Maccabeus:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	5	Eleazar, called Avaran: and Jonathan, whose surname wasApphus.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	6	And when he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Judaand Jerusalem,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	7	He said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see this miseryof my people, and of the holy city, and to dwell there, when itwas delivered into the hand of the enemy, and the sanctuary intothe hand of strangers?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	8	Her temple is become as a man without glory.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	9	Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, herinfants are slain in the streets, her young men with the swordof the enemy.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	10	What nation hath not had a part in her kingdom and gotten ofher spoils?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	11	All her ornaments are taken away; of a free woman she isbecome a bondslave.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	12	And, behold, our sanctuary, even our beauty and our glory, islaid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	13	To what end therefore shall we live any longer?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	14	Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put onsackcloth, and mourned very sore.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	15	In the mean while the king's officers, such as compelled thepeople to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make themsacrifice.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	16	And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also andhis sons came together.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	17	Then answered the king's officers, and said to Mattathias onthis wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man inthis city, and strengthened with sons and brethren:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	18	Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king'scommandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the menof Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou andthy house be in the number of the king's friends, and thou andthy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and manyrewards.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	19	Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Thoughall the nations that are under the king's dominion obey him, andfall away every one from the religion of their fathers, and giveconsent to his commandments:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	20	Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenantof our fathers.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	21	God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	22	We will not hearken to the king's words, to go from ourreligion, either on the right hand, or the left.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	23	Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one ofthe Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which wasat Modin, according to the king's commandment.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	24	Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal,and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew hisanger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him uponthe altar.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	25	Also the king's commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice,he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	26	Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phineesdid unto Zambri the son of Salom.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	27	And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice,saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth thecovenant, let him follow me.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	28	So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all thatever they had in the city.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	29	Then many that sought after justice and judgment went downinto the wilderness, to dwell there:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	30	Both they, and their children, and their wives; and theircattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	31	Now when it was told the king's servants, and the host thatwas at Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, whohad broken the king's commandment, were gone down into thesecret places in the wilderness,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	32	They pursued after them a great number, and having overtakenthem, they camped against them, and made war against them on thesabbath day.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	33	And they said unto them, Let that which ye have done hithertosuffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of theking, and ye shall live.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	34	But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do theking's commandment, to profane the sabbath day.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	35	So then they gave them the battle with all speed.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	36	Howbeit they answered them not, neither cast they a stone atthem, nor stopped the places where they lay hid;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	37	But said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earthwill testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	38	So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, andthey slew them, with their wives and children and their cattle,to the number of a thousand people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	39	Now when Mattathias and his friends understood hereof, theymourned for them right sore.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	40	And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethrenhave done, and fight not for our lives and laws against theheathen, they will now quickly root us out of the earth.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	41	At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shallcome to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fightagainst him; neither will we die all, as our brethren that weremurdered im the secret places.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	42	Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who weremighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devotedunto the law.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	43	Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselvesunto them, and were a stay unto them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	44	So they joined their forces, and smote sinful men in theiranger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to theheathen for succour.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	45	Then Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulleddown the altars:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	46	And what children soever they found within the coast ofIsrael uncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	47	They pursued also after the proud men, and the work prosperedin their hand.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	48	So they recovered the law out of the hand of the Gentiles,and out of the hand of kings, neither suffered they the sinnerto triumph.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	49	Now when the time drew near that Mattathias should die, hesaid unto his sons, Now hath pride and rebuke gotten strength,and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	50	Now therefore, my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and giveyour lives for the covenant of your fathers.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	51	Call to remembrance what acts our fathers did in their time;so shall ye receive great honour and an everlasting name.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	52	Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it wasimputed unto him for righteousness?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	53	Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment andwas made lord of Egypt.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	54	Phinees our father in being zealous and fervent obtained thecovenant of an everlasting priesthood.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	55	Jesus for fulfilling the word was made a judge in Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	56	Caleb for bearing witness before the congregation receivedthe heritage of the land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	57	David for being merciful possessed the throne of aneverlasting kingdom.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	58	Elias for being zealous and fervent for the law was taken upinto heaven.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	59	Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, by believing were saved out ofthe flame.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	60	Daniel for his innocency was delivered from the mouth oflions.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	61	And thus consider ye throughout all ages, that none that puttheir trust in him shall be overcome.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	62	Fear not then the words of a sinful man: for his glory shallbe dung and worms.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	63	To day he shall be lifted up and to morrow he shall not befound, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought iscome to nothing.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	64	Wherefore, ye my sons, be valiant and shew yourselves men inthe behalf of the law; for by it shall ye obtain glory.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	65	And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man ofcounsel, give ear unto him alway: he shall be a father unto you.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	66	As for Judas Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, evenfrom his youth up: let him be your captain, and fight the battleof the people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	67	Take also unto you all those that observe the law, and avengeye the wrong of your people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	68	Recompense fully the heathen, and take heed to thecommandments of the law.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	69	So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	2	70	And he died in the hundred forty and sixth year, and his sonsburied him in the sepulchres of his fathers at Modin, and allIsrael made great lamentation for him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	1	Then his son Judas, called Maccabeus, rose up in his stead.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	2	And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they thatheld with his father, and they fought with cheerfulness thebattle of Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	3	So he gat his people great honour, and put on a breastplateas a giant, and girt his warlike harness about him, and he madebattles, protecting the host with his sword.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	4	In his acts he was like a lion, and like a lion's whelproaring for his prey.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	5	For He pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt upthose that vexed his people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	6	Wherefore the wicked shrunk for fear of him, and all theworkers of iniquity were troubled, because salvation prosperedin his hand.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	7	He grieved also many kings, and made Jacob glad with hisacts, and his memorial is blessed for ever.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	8	Moreover he went through the cities of Juda, destroying theungodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	9	So that he was renowned unto the utmost part of the earth,and he received unto him such as were ready to perish.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	10	Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a greathost out of Samaria, to fight against Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	11	Which thing when Judas perceived, he went forth to meet him,and so he smote him, and slew him: many also fell down slain,but the rest fled.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	12	Wherefore Judas took their spoils, and Apollonius' swordalso, and therewith he fought all his life long.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	13	Now when Seron, a prince of the army of Syria, heard say thatJudas had gathered unto him a multitude and company of thefaithful to go out with him to war;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	14	He said, I will get me a name and honour in the kingdom; forI will go fight with Judas and them that are with him, whodespise the king's commandment.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	15	So he made him ready to go up, and there went with him amighty host of the ungodly to help him, and to be avenged of thechildren of Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	16	And when he came near to the going up of Bethhoron, Judaswent forth to meet him with a small company:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	17	Who, when they saw the host coming to meet them, said untoJudas, How shall we be able, being so few, to fight against sogreat a multitude and so strong, seeing we are ready to faintwith fasting all this day?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	18	Unto whom Judas answered, It is no hard matter for many to beshut up in the hands of a few; and with the God of heaven it isall one, to deliver with a great multitude, or a small company:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	19	For the victory of battle standeth not in the multitude of anhost; but strength cometh from heaven.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	20	They come against us in much pride and iniquity to destroyus, and our wives and children, and to spoil us:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	21	But we fight for our lives and our laws.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	22	Wherefore the Lord himself will overthrow them before ourface: and as for you, be ye not afraid of them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	23	Now as soon as he had left off speaking, he leapt suddenlyupon them, and so Seron and his host was overthrown before him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	24	And they pursued them from the going down of Bethhoron untothe plain, where were slain about eight hundred men of them; andthe residue fled into the land of the Philistines.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	25	Then began the fear of Judas and his brethren, and anexceeding great dread, to fall upon the nations round aboutthem:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	26	Insomuch as his fame came unto the king, and all nationstalked of the battles of Judas.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	27	Now when king Antiochus heard these things, he was full ofindignation: wherefore he sent and gathered together all theforces of his realm, even a very strong army.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	28	He opened also his treasure, and gave his soldiers pay for ayear, commanding them to be ready whensoever he should needthem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	29	Nevertheless, when he saw that the money of his treasuresfailed and that the tributes in the country were small, becauseof the dissension and plague, which he had brought upon the landin taking away the laws which had been of old time;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	30	He feared that he should not be able to bear the charges anylonger, nor to have such gifts to give so liberally as he didbefore: for he had abounded above the kings that were beforehim.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	31	Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his mind, he determinedto go into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countries,and to gather much money.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	32	So he left Lysias, a nobleman, and one of the blood royal, tooversee the affairs of the king from the river Euphrates untothe borders of Egypt:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	33	And to bring up his son Antiochus, until he came again.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	34	Moreover he delivered unto him the half of his forces, andthe elephants, and gave him charge of all things that he wouldhave done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Juda andJerusalem:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	35	To wit, that he should send an army against them, to destroyand root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant ofJerusalem, and to take away their memorial from that place;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	36	And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, anddivide their land by lot.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	37	So the king took the half of the forces that remained, anddeparted from Antioch, his royal city, the hundred forty andseventh year; and having passed the river Euphrates, he wentthrough the high countries.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	38	Then Lysias chose Ptolemee the son of Dorymenes, Nicanor, andGorgias, mighty men of the king's friends:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	39	And with them he sent forty thousand footmen, and seventhousand horsemen, to go into the land of Juda, and to destroyit, as the king commanded.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	40	So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitchedby Emmaus in the plain country.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	41	And the merchants of the country, hearing the fame of them,took silver and gold very much, with servants, and came into thecamp to buy the children of Israel for slaves: a power also ofSyria and of the land of the Philistines joined themselves untothem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	42	Now when Judas and his brethren saw that miseries weremultiplied, and that the forces did encamp themselves in theirborders: for they knew how the king had given commandment todestroy the people, and utterly abolish them;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	43	They said one to another, Let us restore the decayed fortuneof our people, and let us fight for our people and thesanctuary.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	44	Then was the congregation gathered together, that they mightbe ready for battle, and that they might pray, and ask mercy andcompassion.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	45	Now Jerusalem lay void as a wilderness, there was none of herchildren that went in or out: the sanctuary also was troddendown, and aliens kept the strong hold; the heathen had theirhabitation in that place; and joy was taken from Jacob, and thepipe with the harp ceased.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	46	Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselves together, andcame to Maspha, over against Jerusalem; for in Maspha was theplace where they prayed aforetime in Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	47	Then they fasted that day, and put on sackcloth, and castashes upon their heads, and rent their clothes,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	48	And laid open the book of the law, wherein the heathen hadsought to paint the likeness of their images.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	49	They brought also the priests' garments, and the firstfruits,and the tithes: and the Nazarites they stirred up, who hadaccomplished their days.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	50	Then cried they with a loud voice toward heaven, saying, Whatshall we do with these, and whither shall we carry them away?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	51	For thy sanctuary is trodden down and profaned, and thypriests are in heaviness, and brought low.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	52	And lo, the heathen are assembled together against us todestroy us: what things they imagine against us, thou knowest.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	53	How shall we be able to stand against them, except thou, OGod, be our help?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	54	Then sounded they with trumpets, and cried with a loud voice.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	55	And after this Judas ordained captains over the people, evencaptains over thousands, and over hundreds, and over fifties,and over tens.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	56	But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothedwives, or were planting vineyards, or were fearful, those hecommanded that they should return, every man to his own house,according to the law.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	57	So the camp removed, and pitched upon the south side ofEmmaus.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	58	And Judas said, arm yourselves, and be valiant men, and seethat ye be in readiness against the morning, that ye may fightwith these nations, that are assembled together against us todestroy us and our sanctuary:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	59	For it is better for us to die in battle, than to behold thecalamities of our people and our sanctuary.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	3	60	Nevertheless, as the will of God is in heaven, so let him do.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	1	Then took Gorgias five thousand footmen, and a thousand ofthe best horsemen, and removed out of the camp by night;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	2	To the end he might rush in upon the camp of the Jews, andsmite them suddenly. And the men of the fortress were hisguides.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	3	Now when Judas heard thereof he himself removed, and thevaliant men with him, that he might smite the king's army whichwas at Emmaus,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	4	While as yet the forces were dispersed from the camp.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	5	In the mean season came Gorgias by night into the camp ofJudas: and when he found no man there, he sought them in themountains: for said he, These fellows flee from us
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	6	But as soon as it was day, Judas shewed himself in the plainwith three thousand men, who nevertheless had neither armour norswords to their minds.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	7	And they saw the camp of the heathen, that it was strong andwell harnessed, and compassed round about with horsemen; andthese were expert of war.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	8	Then said Judas to the men that were with him, Fear ye nottheir multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	9	Remember how our fathers were delivered in the Red sea, whenPharaoh pursued them with an army.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	10	Now therefore let us cry unto heaven, if peradventure theLord will have mercy upon us, and remember the covenant of ourfathers, and destroy this host before our face this day:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	11	That so all the heathen may know that there is one whodelivereth and saveth Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	12	Then the strangers lifted up their eyes, and saw them comingover against them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	13	Wherefore they went out of the camp to battle; but they thatwere with Judas sounded their trumpets.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	14	So they joined battle, and the heathen being discomfited fledinto the plain.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	15	Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slain with the sword:for they pursued them unto Gazera, and unto the plains ofIdumea, and Azotus, and Jamnia, so that there were slain of themupon a three thousand men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	16	This done, Judas returned again with his host from pursuingthem,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	17	And said to the people, Be not greedy of the spoil inasmuchas there is a battle before us,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	18	And Gorgias and his host are here by us in the mountain: butstand ye now against our enemies, and overcome them, and afterthis ye may boldly take the spoils.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	19	As Judas was yet speaking these words, there appeared a partof them looking out of the mountain:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	20	Who when they perceived that the Jews had put their host toflight and were burning the tents; for the smoke that was seendeclared what was done:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	21	When therefore they perceived these things, they were soreafraid, and seeing also the host of Judas in the plain ready tofight,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	22	They fled every one into the land of strangers.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	23	Then Judas returned to spoil the tents, where they got muchgold, and silver, and blue silk, and purple of the sea, andgreat riches.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	24	After this they went home, and sung a song of thanksgiving,and praised the Lord in heaven: because it is good, because hismercy endureth forever.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	25	Thus Israel had a great deliverance that day.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	26	Now all the strangers that had escaped came and told Lysiaswhat had happened:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	27	Who, when he heard thereof, was confounded and discouraged,because neither such things as he would were done unto Israel,nor such things as the king commanded him were come to pass.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	28	The next year therefore following Lysias gathered togetherthreescore thousand choice men of foot, and five thousandhorsemen, that he might subdue them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	29	So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents atBethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	30	And when he saw that mighty army, he prayed and said, Blessedart thou, O Saviour of Israel, who didst quell the violence ofthe mighty man by the hand of thy servant David, and gavest thehost of strangers into the hands of Jonathan the son of Saul,and his armourbearer;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	31	Shut up this army in the hand of thy people Israel, and letthem be confounded in their power and horsemen:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	32	Make them to be of no courage, and cause the boldness oftheir strength to fall away, and let them quake at theirdestruction:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	33	Cast them down with the sword of them that love thee, and letall those that know thy name praise thee with thanksgiving.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	34	So they joined battle; and there were slain of the host ofLysias about five thousand men, even before them were theyslain.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	35	Now when Lysias saw his army put to flight, and the manlinessof Judas' soldiers, and how they were ready either to live ordie valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together acompany of strangers, and having made his army greater than itwas, he purposed to come again into Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	36	Then said Judas and his brethren, Behold, our enemies arediscomfited: let us go up to cleanse and dedicate the sanctuary.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	37	Upon this all the host assembled themselves together, andwent up into mount Sion.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	38	And when they saw the sanctuary desolate, and the altarprofaned, and the gates burned up, and shrubs growing in thecourts as in a forest, or in one of the mountains, yea, and thepriests' chambers pulled down;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	39	They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and castashes upon their heads,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	40	And fell down flat to the ground upon their faces, and blewan alarm with the trumpets, and cried toward heaven.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	41	Then Judas appointed certain men to fight against those thatwere in the fortress, until he had cleansed the sanctuary.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	42	So he chose priests of blameless conversation, such as hadpleasure in the law:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	43	Who cleansed the sanctuary, and bare out the defiled stonesinto an unclean place.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	44	And when as they consulted what to do with the altar of burntofferings, which was profaned;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	45	They thought it best to pull it down, lest it should be areproach to them, because the heathen had defiled it: whereforethey pulled it down,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	46	And laid up the stones in the mountain of the temple in aconvenient place, until there should come a prophet to shew whatshould be done with them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	47	Then they took whole stones according to the law, and built anew altar according to the former;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	48	And made up the sanctuary, and the things that were withinthe temple, and hallowed the courts.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	49	They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple theybrought the candlestick, and the altar of burnt offerings, andof incense, and the table.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	50	And upon the altar they burned incense, and the lamps thatwere upon the candlestick they lighted, that they might givelight in the temple.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	51	Furthermore they set the loaves upon the table, and spreadout the veils, and finished all the works which they had begunto make.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	52	Now on the five and twentieth day of the ninth month, whichis called the month Casleu, in the hundred forty and eighthyear, they rose up betimes in the morning,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	53	And offered sacrifice according to the law upon the new altarof burnt offerings, which they had made.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	54	Look, at what time and what day the heathen had profaned it,even in that was it dedicated with songs, and citherns, andharps, and cymbals.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	55	Then all the people fell upon their faces, worshipping andpraising the God of heaven, who had given them good success.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	56	And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight days andoffered burnt offerings with gladness, and sacrificed thesacrifice of deliverance and praise.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	57	They decked also the forefront of the temple with crowns ofgold, and with shields; and the gates and the chambers theyrenewed, and hanged doors upon them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	58	Thus was there very great gladness among the people, for thatthe reproach of the heathen was put away.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	59	Moreover Judas and his brethren with the whole congregationof Israel ordained, that the days of the dedication of the altarshould be kept in their season from year to year by the space ofeight days, from the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu,with mirth and gladness.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	60	At that time also they builded up the mount Sion with highwalls and strong towers round about, lest the Gentiles shouldcome and tread it down as they had done before.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	4	61	And they set there a garrison to keep it, and fortifiedBethsura to preserve it; that the people might have a defenceagainst Idumea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	1	Now when the nations round about heard that the altar wasbuilt and the sanctuary renewed as before, it displeased themvery much.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	2	Wherefore they thought to destroy the generation of Jacobthat was among them, and thereupon they began to slay anddestroy the people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	3	Then Judas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea atArabattine, because they besieged Gael: and he gave them a greatoverthrow, and abated their courage, and took their spoils.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	4	Also he remembered the injury of the children of Bean, whohad been a snare and an offence unto the people, in that theylay in wait for them in the ways.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	5	He shut them up therefore in the towers, and encamped againstthem, and destroyed them utterly, and burned the towers of thatplace with fire, and all that were therein.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	6	Afterward he passed over to the children of Ammon, where hefound a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus theircaptain.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	7	So he fought many battles with them, till at length they werediscomfited before him; and he smote them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	8	And when he had taken Jazar, with the towns belongingthereto, he returned into Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	9	Then the heathen that were at Galaad assembled themselvestogether against the Israelites that were in their quarters, todestroy them; but they fled to the fortress of Dathema.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	10	And sent letters unto Judas and his brethren, The heathenthat are round about us are assembled together against us todestroy us:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	11	And they are preparing to come and take the fortresswhereunto we are fled, Timotheus being captain of their host.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	12	Come now therefore, and deliver us from their hands, for manyof us are slain:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	13	Yea, all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie areput to death: their wives and their children also they havecarried away captives, and borne away their stuff; and they havedestroyed there about a thousand men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	14	While these letters were yet reading, behold, there cameother messengers from Galilee with their clothes rent, whoreported on this wise,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	15	And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and allGalilee of the Gentiles, are assembled together against us toconsume us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	16	Now when Judas and the people heard these words, thereassembled a great congregation together, to consult what theyshould do for their brethren, that were in trouble, andassaulted of them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	17	Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men,and go and deliver thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I andJonathan my brother will go into the country of Galaad.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	18	So he left Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captainsof the people, with the remnant of the host in Judea to keep it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	19	Unto whom he gave commandment, saying, Take ye the charge ofthis people, and see that ye make not war against the heathenuntil the time that we come again.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	20	Now unto Simon were given three thousand men to go intoGalilee, and unto Judas eight thousand men for the country ofGalaad.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	21	Then went Simon into Galilee, where he fought many battleswith the heathen, so that the heathen were discomfited by him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	22	And he pursued them unto the gate of Ptolemais; and therewere slain of the heathen about three thousand men, whose spoilshe took.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	23	And those that were in Galilee, and in Arbattis, with theirwives and their children, and all that they had, took he awaywith him, and brought them into Judea with great joy.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	24	Judas Maccabeus also and his brother Jonathan went overJordan, and travelled three days' journey in the wilderness,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	25	Where they met with the Nabathites, who came unto them in apeaceable manner, and told them every thing that had happened totheir brethren in the land of Galaad:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	26	And how that many of them were shut up in Bosora, and Bosor,and Alema, Casphor, Maked, and Carnaim; all these cities arestrong and great:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	27	And that they were shut up in the rest of the cities of thecountry of Galaad, and that against to morrow they had appointedto bring their host against the forts, and to take them, and todestroy them all in one day.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	28	Hereupon Judas and his host turned suddenly by the way of thewilderness unto Bosora; and when he had won the city, he slewall the males with the edge of the sword, and took all theirspoils, and burned the city with fire,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	29	From whence he removed by night, and went till he came to thefortress.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	30	And betimes in the morning they looked up, and, behold, therewas an innumerable people bearing ladders and other engines ofwar, to take the fortress: for they assaulted them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	31	When Judas therefore saw that the battle was begun, and thatthe cry of the city went up to heaven, with trumpets, and agreat sound,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	32	He said unto his host, Fight this day for your brethren.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	33	So he went forth behind them in three companies, who soundedtheir trumpets, and cried with prayer.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	34	Then the host of Timotheus, knowing that it was Maccabeus,fled from him: wherefore he smote them with a great slaughter;so that there were killed of them that day about eight thousandmen.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	35	This done, Judas turned aside to Maspha; and after he hadassaulted it he took and slew all the males therein, andreceived the spoils thereof and and burnt it with fire.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	36	From thence went he, and took Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and theother cities of the country of Galaad.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	37	After these things gathered Timotheus another host andencamped against Raphon beyond the brook.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	38	So Judas sent men to espy the host, who brought him word,saying, All the heathen that be round about us are assembledunto them, even a very great host.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	39	He hath also hired the Arabians to help them and they havepitched their tents beyond the brook, ready to come and fightagainst thee. Upon this Judas went to meet them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	40	Then Timotheus said unto the captains of his host, When Judasand his host come near the brook, if he pass over first unto us,we shall not be able to withstand him; for he will mightilyprevail against us:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	41	But if he be afraid, and camp beyond the river, we shall goover unto him, and prevail against him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	42	Now when Judas came near the brook, he caused the scribes ofthe people to remain by the brook: unto whom he gavecommandment, saying, Suffer no man to remain in the camp, butlet all come to the battle.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	43	So he went first over unto them, and all the people afterhim: then all the heathen, being discomfited before him, castaway their weapons, and fled unto the temple that was atCarnaim.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	44	But they took the city, and burned the temple with all thatwere therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither could they standany longer before Judas.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	45	Then Judas gathered together all the Israelites that were inthe country of Galaad, from the least unto the greatest, eventheir wives, and their children, and their stuff, a very greathost, to the end they might come into the land of Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	46	Now when they came unto Ephron, (this was a great city in theway as they should go, very well fortified) they could not turnfrom it, either on the right hand or the left, but must needspass through the midst of it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	47	Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped up the gateswith stones.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	48	Whereupon Judas sent unto them in peaceable manner, saying,Let us pass through your land to go into our own country, andnone shall do you any hurt; we will only pass through on foot:howbeit they would not open unto him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	49	Wherefore Judas commanded a proclamation to be madethroughout the host, that every man should pitch his tent in theplace where he was.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	50	So the soldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that dayand all that night, till at the length the city was deliveredinto his hands:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	51	Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, andrased the city, and took the spoils thereof, and passed throughthe city over them that were slain.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	52	After this went they over Jordan into the great plain beforeBethsan.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	53	And Judas gathered together those that came behind, andexhorted the people all the way through, till they came into theland of Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	54	So they went up to mount Sion with joy and gladness, wherethey offered burnt offerings, because not one of them were slainuntil they had returned in peace.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	55	Now what time as Judas and Jonathan were in the land ofGalaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	56	Joseph the son of Zacharias, and Azarias, captains of thegarrisons, heard of the valiant acts and warlike deeds whichthey had done.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	57	Wherefore they said, Let us also get us a name, and go fightagainst the heathen that are round about us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	58	So when they had given charge unto the garrison that was withthem, they went toward Jamnia.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	59	Then came Gorgias and his men out of the city to fightagainst them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	60	And so it was, that Joseph and Azaras were put to flight, andpursued unto the borders of Judea: and there were slain that dayof the people of Israel about two thousand men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	61	Thus was there a great overthrow among the children ofIsrael, because they were not obedient unto Judas and hisbrethren, but thought to do some valiant act.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	62	Moreover these men came not of the seed of those, by whosehand deliverance was given unto Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	63	Howbeit the man Judas and his brethren were greatly renownedin the sight of all Israel, and of all the heathen, wheresoevertheir name was heard of;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	64	Insomuch as the the people assembled unto them with joyfulacclamations.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	65	Afterward went Judas forth with his brethren, and foughtagainst the children of Esau in the land toward the south, wherehe smote Hebron, and the towns thereof, and pulled down thefortress of it, and burned the towers thereof round about.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	66	From thence he removed to go into the land of thePhilistines, and passed through Samaria.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	67	At that time certain priests, desirous to shew their valour,were slain in battle, for that they went out to fightunadvisedly.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	5	68	So Judas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, andwhen he had pulled down their altars, and burned their carvedimages with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into theland of Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	1	About that time king Antiochus travelling through the highcountries heard say, that Elymais in the country of Persia was acity greatly renowned for riches, silver, and gold;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	2	And that there was in it a very rich temple, wherein werecoverings of gold, and breastplates, and shields, whichAlexander, son of Philip, the Macedonian king, who reigned firstamong the Grecians, had left there.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	3	Wherefore he came and sought to take the city, and to spoilit; but he was not able, because they of the city, having hadwarning thereof,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	4	Rose up against him in battle: so he fled, and departedthence with great heaviness, and returned to Babylon.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	5	Moreover there came one who brought him tidings into Persia,that the armies, which went against the land of Judea, were putto flight:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	6	And that Lysias, who went forth first with a great power wasdriven away of the Jews; and that they were made strong by thearmour, and power, and store of spoils, which they had gotten ofthe armies, whom they had destroyed:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	7	Also that they had pulled down the abomination, which he hadset up upon the altar in Jerusalem, and that they had compassedabout the sanctuary with high walls, as before, and his cityBethsura.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	8	Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished andsore moved: whereupon he laid him down upon his bed, and fellsick for grief, because it had not befallen him as he lookedfor.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	9	And there he continued many days: for his grief was ever moreand more, and he made account that he should die.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	10	Wherefore he called for all his friends, and said unto them,The sleep is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth for verycare.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	11	And I thought with myself, Into what tribulation am I come,and how great a flood of misery is it, wherein now I am! for Iwas bountiful and beloved in my power.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	12	But now I remember the evils that I did at Jerusalem, andthat I took all the vessels of gold and silver that weretherein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Judea without acause.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	13	I perceive therefore that for this cause these troubles arecome upon me, and, behold, I perish through great grief in astrange land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	14	Then called he for Philip, one of his friends, who he maderuler over all his realm,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	15	And gave him the crown, and his robe, and his signet, to theend he should bring up his son Antiochus, and nourish him up forthe kingdom.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	16	So king Antiochus died there in the hundred forty and ninthyear.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	17	Now when Lysias knew that the king was dead, he set upAntiochus his son, whom he had brought up being young, to reignin his stead, and his name he called Eupator.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	18	About this time they that were in the tower shut up theIsraelites round about the sanctuary, and sought always theirhurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	19	Wherefore Judas, purposing to destroy them, called all thepeople together to besiege them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	20	So they came together, and besieged them in the hundred andfiftieth year, and he made mounts for shot against them, andother engines.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	21	Howbeit certain of them that were besieged got forth, untowhom some ungodly men of Israel joined themselves:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	22	And they went unto the king, and said, How long will it beere thou execute judgment, and avenge our brethren?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	23	We have been willing to serve thy father, and to do as hewould have us, and to obey his commandments;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	24	For which cause they of our nation besiege the tower, and arealienated from us: moreover as many of us as they could light onthey slew, and spoiled our inheritance.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	25	Neither have they stretched out their hand against us only,but also against their borders.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	26	And, behold, this day are they besieging the tower atJerusalem, to take it: the sanctuary also and Bethsura have theyfortified.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	27	Wherefore if thou dost not prevent them quickly, they will dothe greater things than these, neither shalt thou be able torule them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	28	Now when the king heard this, he was angry, and gatheredtogether all his friends, and the captains of his army, andthose that had charge of the horse.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	29	There came also unto him from other kingdoms, and from islesof the sea, bands of hired soldiers.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	30	So that the number of his army was an hundred thousandfootmen, and twenty thousand horsemen, and two and thirtyelephants exercised in battle.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	31	These went through Idumea, and pitched against Bethsura,which they assaulted many days, making engines of war; but theyof Bethsura came out, and burned them with fire, and foughtvaliantly.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	32	Upon this Judas removed from the tower, and pitched inBathzacharias, over against the king's camp.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	33	Then the king rising very early marched fiercely with hishost toward Bathzacharias, where his armies made them ready tobattle, and sounded the trumpets.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	34	And to the end they might provoke the elephants to fight,they shewed them the blood of grapes and mulberries.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	35	Moreover they divided the beasts among the armies, and forevery elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with coatsof mail, and with helmets of brass on their heads; and besidethis, for every beast were ordained five hundred horsemen of thebest.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	36	These were ready at every occasion: wheresoever the beastwas, and whithersoever the beast went, they went also, neitherdeparted they from him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	37	And upon the beasts were there strong towers of wood, whichcovered every one of them, and were girt fast unto them withdevices: there were also upon every one two and thirty strongmen, that fought upon them, beside the Indian that ruled him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	38	As for the remnant of the horsemen, they set them on thisside and that side at the two parts of the host giving themsigns what to do, and being harnessed all over amidst the ranks.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	39	Now when the sun shone upon the shields of gold and brass,the mountains glistered therewith, and shined like lamps offire.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	40	So part of the king's army being spread upon the highmountains, and part on the valleys below, they marched on safelyand in order.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	41	Wherefore all that heard the noise of their multitude, andthe marching of the company, and the rattling of the harness,were moved: for the army was very great and mighty.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	42	Then Judas and his host drew near, and entered into battle,and there were slain of the king's army six hundred men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	43	Eleazar also, surnamed Savaran, perceiving that one of thebeasts, armed with royal harness, was higher than all the rest,and supposing that the king was upon him,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	44	Put himself in jeopardy, to the end he might deliver hispeople, and get him a perpetual name:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	45	Wherefore he ran upon him courageously through the midst ofthe battle, slaying on the right hand and on the left, so thatthey were divided from him on both sides.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	46	Which done, he crept under the elephant, and thrust himunder, and slew him: whereupon the elephant fell down upon him,and there he died.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	47	Howbeit the rest of the Jews seeing the strength of the king,and the violence of his forces, turned away from them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	48	Then the king's army went up to Jerusalem to meet them, andthe king pitched his tents against Judea, and against mountSion.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	49	But with them that were in Bethsura he made peace: for theycame out of the city, because they had no victuals there toendure the siege, it being a year of rest to the land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	50	So the king took Bethsura, and set a garrison there to keepit.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	51	As for the sanctuary, he besieged it many days: and set thereartillery with engines and instruments to cast fire and stones,and pieces to cast darts and slings.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	52	Whereupon they also made engines against their engines, andheld them battle a long season.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	53	Yet at the last, their vessels being without victuals, (forthat it was the seventh year, and they in Judea that weredelivered from the Gentiles, had eaten up the residue of thestore;)
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	54	There were but a few left in the sanctuary, because thefamine did so prevail against them, that they were fain todisperse themselves, every man to his own place.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	55	At that time Lysias heard say, that Philip, whom Antiochusthe king, whiles he lived, had appointed to bring up his sonAntiochus, that he might be king,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	56	Was returned out of Persia and Media, and the king's hostalso that went with him, and that he sought to take unto him theruling of the affairs.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	57	Wherefore he went in all haste, and said to the king and thecaptains of the host and the company, We decay daily, and ourvictuals are but small, and the place we lay siege unto isstrong, and the affairs of the kingdom lie upon us:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	58	Now therefore let us be friends with these men, and makepeace with them, and with all their nation;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	59	And covenant with them, that they shall live after theirlaws, as they did before: for they are therefore displeased, andhave done all these things, because we abolished their laws.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	60	So the king and the princes were content: wherefore he sentunto them to make peace; and they accepted thereof.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	61	Also the king and the princes made an oath unto them:whereupon they went out of the strong hold.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	62	Then the king entered into mount Sion; but when he saw thestrength of the place, he broke his oath that he had made, andgave commandment to pull down the wall round about.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	6	63	Afterward departed he in all haste, and returned untoAntiochia, where he found Philip to be master of the city: so hefought against him, and took the city by force.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	1	In the hundred and one and fiftieth year Demetrius the son ofSeleucus departed from Rome, and came up with a few men unto acity of the sea coast, and reigned there.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	2	And as he entered into the palace of his ancestors, so itwas, that his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias, to bringthem unto him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	3	Wherefore, when he knew it, he said, Let me not see theirfaces.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	4	So his host slew them. Now when Demetrius was set upon thethrone of his kingdom,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	5	There came unto him all the wicked and ungodly men of Israel,having Alcimus, who was desirous to be high priest, for theircaptain:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	6	And they accused the people to the king, saying, Judas andhis brethren have slain all thy friends, and driven us out ofour own land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	7	Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let himgo and see what havock he hath made among us, and in the king'sland, and let him punish them with all them that aid them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	8	Then the king chose Bacchides, a friend of the king, whoruled beyond the flood, and was a great man in the kingdom, andfaithful to the king,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	9	And him he sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom he made highpriest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of thechildren of Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	10	So they departed, and came with a great power into the landof Judea, where they sent messengers to Judas and his brethrenwith peaceable words deceitfully.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	11	But they gave no heed to their words; for they saw that theywere come with a great power.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	12	Then did there assemble unto Alcimus and Bacchides a companyof scribes, to require justice.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	13	Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israelthat sought peace of them:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	14	For said they, One that is a priest of the seed of Aaron iscome with this army, and he will do us no wrong.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	15	So he spake unto them, peaceably, and sware unto them,saying, we will procure the harm neither of you nor yourfriends.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	16	Whereupon they believed him: howbeit he took of themthreescore men, and slew them in one day, according to the wordswhich he wrote,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	17	The flesh of thy saints have they cast out, and their bloodhave they shed round about Jerusalem, and there was none to burythem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	18	Wherefore the fear and dread of them fell upon all thepeople, who said, There is neither truth nor righteousness inthem; for they have broken the covenant and oath that they made.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	19	After this, removed Bacchides from Jerusalem, and pitched histents in Bezeth, where he sent and took many of the men that hadforsaken him, and certain of the people also, and when he hadslain them, he cast them into the great pit.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	20	Then committed he the country to Alcimus, and left with him apower to aid him: so Bacchides went to the king.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	21	But Alcimus contended for the high priesthood.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	22	And unto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who,after they had gotten the land of Juda into their power, didmuch hurt in Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	23	Now when Judas saw all the mischief that Alcimus and hiscompany had done among the Israelites, even above the heathen,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	24	He went out into all the coasts of Judea round about, andtook vengeance of them that had revolted from him, so that theydurst no more go forth into the country.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	25	On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Judas and hiscompany had gotten the upper hand, and knew that he was not ableto abide their force, he went again to the king, and said allthe worst of them that he could.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	26	Then the king sent Nicanor, one of his honourable princes, aman that bare deadly hate unto Israel, with commandment todestroy the people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	27	So Nicanor came to Jerusalem with a great force; and sentunto Judas and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words,saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	28	Let there be no battle between me and you; I will come with afew men, that I may see you in peace.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	29	He came therefore to Judas, and they saluted one anotherpeaceably. Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Judasby violence.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	30	Which thing after it was known to Judas, to wit, that he cameunto him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would seehis face no more.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	31	Nicanor also, when he saw that his counsel was discovered,went out to fight against Judas beside Capharsalama:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	32	Where there were slain of Nicanor's side about five thousandmen, and the rest fled into the city of David.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	33	After this went Nicanor up to mount Sion, and there came outof the sanctuary certain of the priests and certain of theelders of the people, to salute him peaceably, and to shew himthe burnt sacrifice that was offered for the king.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	34	But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused themshamefully, and spake proudly,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	35	And sware in his wrath, saying, Unless Judas and his host benow delivered into my hands, if ever I come again in safety, Iwill burn up this house: and with that he went out in a greatrage.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	36	Then the priests entered in, and stood before the altar andthe temple, weeping, and saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	37	Thou, O Lord, didst choose this house to be called by thyname, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	38	Be avenged of this man and his host, and let them fall by thesword: remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not tocontinue any longer.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	39	So Nicanor went out of Jerusalem, and pitched his tents inBethhoron, where an host out of Syria met him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	40	But Judas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and therehe prayed, saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	41	O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of theAssyrians blasphemed, thine angel went out, and smote an hundredfourscore and five thousand of them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	42	Even so destroy thou this host before us this day, that therest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thysanctuary, and judge thou him according to his wickedness.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	43	So the thirteenth day of the month Adar the hosts joinedbattle: but Nicanor's host was discomfited, and he himself wasfirst slain in the battle.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	44	Now when Nicanor's host saw that he was slain, they cast awaytheir weapons, and fled.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	45	Then they pursued after them a day's journey, from Adasa untoGazera, sounding an alarm after them with their trumpets.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	46	Whereupon they came forth out of all the towns of Judea roundabout, and closed them in; so that they, turning back upon themthat pursued them, were all slain with the sword, and not one ofthem was left.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	47	Afterwards they took the spoils, and the prey, and smote offNicanors head, and his right hand, which he stretched out soproudly, and brought them away, and hanged them up towardJerusalem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	48	For this cause the people rejoiced greatly, and they keptthat day a day of great gladness.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	49	Moreover they ordained to keep yearly this day, being thethirteenth of Adar.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	7	50	Thus the land of Juda was in rest a little while.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	1	Now Judas had heard of the the Romans, that they were mightyand valiant men, and such as would lovingly accept all thatjoined themselves unto them, and make a league of amity with allthat came unto them;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	2	And that they were men of great valour. It was told him alsoof their wars and noble acts which they had done among theGalatians, and how they had conquered them, and brought themunder tribute;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	3	And what they had done in the country of Spain, for thewinning of the mines of the silver and gold which is there;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	4	And that by their policy and patience they had conquered allthe place, though it were very far from them; and the kings alsothat came against them from the uttermost part of the earth,till they had discomfited them, and given them a greatoverthrow, so that the rest did give them tribute every year:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	5	Beside this, how they had discomfited in battle Philip, andPerseus, king of the Citims, with others that lifted upthemselves against them, and had overcome them:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	6	How also Antiochus the great king of Asia, that came againstthem in battle, having an hundred and twenty elephants, withhorsemen, and chariots, and a very great army, was discomfitedby them;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	7	And how they took him alive, and covenanted that he and suchas reigned after him should pay a great tribute, and givehostages, and that which was agreed upon,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	8	And the country of India, and Media and Lydia and of thegoodliest countries, which they took of him, and gave to kingEumenes:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	9	Moreover how the Grecians had determined to come and destroythem;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	10	And that they, having knowledge thereof sent against them acertain captain, and fighting with them slew many of them, andcarried away captives their wives and their children, andspoiled them, and took possession of their lands, and pulleddown their strong holds, and brought them to be their servantsunto this day:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	11	It was told him besides, how they destroyed and brought undertheir dominion all other kingdoms and isles that at any timeresisted them;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	12	But with their friends and such as relied upon them they keptamity: and that they had conquered kingdoms both far and nigh,insomuch as all that heard of their name were afraid of them:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	13	Also that, whom they would help to a kingdom, those reign;and whom again they would, they displace: finally, that theywere greatly exalted:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	14	Yet for all this none of them wore a crown or was clothed inpurple, to be magnified thereby:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	15	Moreover how they had made for themselves a senate house,wherein three hundred and twenty men sat in council daily,consulting alway for the people, to the end they might be wellordered:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	16	And that they committed their government to one man everyyear, who ruled over all their country, and that all wereobedient to that one, and that there was neither envy noremmulation among them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	17	In consideration of these things, Judas chose Eupolemus theson of John, the son of Accos, and Jason the son of Eleazar, andsent them to Rome, to make a league of amity and confederacywith them,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	18	And to intreat them that they would take the yoke from them;for they saw that the kingdom of the Grecians did oppress Israelwith servitude.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	19	They went therefore to Rome, which was a very great journey,and came into the senate, where they spake and said.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	20	Judas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of theJews, have sent us unto you, to make a confederacy and peacewith you, and that we might be registered your confederates andfriends.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	21	So that matter pleased the Romans well.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	22	And this is the copy of the epistle which the senate wroteback again in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that therethey might have by them a memorial of peace and confederacy:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	23	Good success be to the Romans, and to the people of the Jews,by sea and by land for ever: the sword also and enemy be farfrom them,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	24	If there come first any war upon the Romans or any of theirconfederates throughout all their dominion,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	25	The people of the Jews shall help them, as the time shall beappointed, with all their heart:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	26	Neither shall they give any thing unto them that make warupon them, or aid them with victuals, weapons, money, or ships,as it hath seemed good unto the Romans; but they shall keeptheir covenants without taking any thing therefore.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	27	In the same manner also, if war come first upon the nation ofthe Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart,according as the time shall be appointed them:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	28	Neither shall victuals be given to them that take partagainst them, or weapons, or money, or ships, as it hath seemedgood to the Romans; but they shall keep their covenants, andthat without deceit.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	29	According to these articles did the Romans make a covenantwith the people of the Jews.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	30	Howbeit if hereafter the one party or the other shall thinkto meet to add or diminish any thing, they may do it at theirpleasures, and whatsoever they shall add or take away shall beratified.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	31	And as touching the evils that Demetrius doeth to the Jews,we have written unto him, saying, Wherefore thou made thy yokeheavy upon our friends and confederates the Jews?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	8	32	If therefore they complain any more against thee, we will dothem justice, and fight with thee by sea and by land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	1	Furthermore, when Demetrius heard the Nicanor and his hostwere slain in battle, he sent Bacchides and Alcimus into theland of Judea the second time, and with them the chief strengthof his host:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	2	Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, andpitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, andafter they had won it, they slew much people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	3	Also the first month of the hundred fifty and second yearthey encamped before Jerusalem:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	4	From whence they removed, and went to Berea, with twentythousand footmen and two thousand horsemen.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	5	Now Judas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousandchosen men with him:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	6	Who seeing the multitude of the other army to he so greatwere sore afraid; whereupon many conveyed themselves out of thehost, insomuch as abode of them no more but eight hundred men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	7	When Judas therefore saw that his host slipt away, and thatthe battle pressed upon him, he was sore troubled in mind, andmuch distressed, for that he had no time to gather themtogether.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	8	Nevertheless unto them that remained he said, Let us ariseand go up against our enemies, if peradventure we may be able tofight with them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	9	But they dehorted him, saying, We shall never be able: let usnow rather save our lives, and hereafter we will return with ourbrethren, and fight against them: for we are but few.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	10	Then Judas said, God forbid that I should do this thing, andflee away from them: if our time be come, let us die manfullyfor our brethren, and let us not stain our honour.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	11	With that the host of Bacchides removed out of their tents,and stood over against them, their horsemen being divided intotwo troops, and their slingers and archers going before the hostand they that marched in the foreward were all mighty men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	12	As for Bacchides, he was in the right wing: so the host drewnear on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	13	They also of Judas' side, even they sounded their trumpetsalso, so that the earth shook at the noise of the armies, andthe battle continued from morning till night.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	14	Now when Judas perceived that Bacchides and the strength ofhis army were on the right side, he took with him all the hardymen,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	15	Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them unto themount Azotus.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	16	But when they of the left wing saw that they of the rightwing were discomfited, they followed upon Judas and those thatwere with him hard at the heels from behind:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	17	Whereupon there was a sore battle, insomuch as many wereslain on both parts.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	18	Judas also was killed, and the remnant fled.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	19	THen Jonathan and Simon took Judas their brother, and buriedhim in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modin.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	20	Moreover they bewailed him, and all Israel made greatlamentation for him, and mourned many days, saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	21	How is the valiant man fallen, that delivered Israel!
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	22	As for the other things concerning Judas and his wars, andthe noble acts which he did, and his greatness, they are notwritten: for they were very many.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	23	Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forththeir heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up allsuch as wrought iniquity.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	24	In those days also was there a very great famine, by reasonwhereof the country revolted, and went with them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	25	Then Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lords ofthe country.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	26	And they made enquiry and search for Judas' friends, andbrought them unto Bacchides, who took vengeance of them, andused them despitefully.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	27	So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereofwas not since the time that a prophet was not seen among them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	28	For this cause all Judas' friends came together, and saidunto Jonathan,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	29	Since thy brother Judas died, we have no man like him to goforth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them ofour nation that are adversaries to us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	30	Now therefore we have chosen thee this day to be our princeand captain in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battles.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	31	Upon this Jonathan took the governance upon him at that time,and rose up instead of his brother Judas.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	32	But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for toslay him
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	33	Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were withhim, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, andpitched their tents by the water of the pool Asphar.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	34	Which when Bacchides understood, he came near to Jordan withall his host upon the sabbath day.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	35	Now Jonathan had sent his brother John, a captain of thepeople, to pray his friends the Nabathites, that they mightleave with them their carriage, which was much.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	36	But the children of Jambri came out of Medaba, and took John,and all that he had, and went their way with it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	37	After this came word to Jonathan and Simon his brother, thatthe children of Jambri made a great marriage, and were bringingthe bride from Nadabatha with a great train, as being thedaughter of one of the great princes of Chanaan.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	38	Therefore they remembered John their brother, and went up,and hid themselves under the covert of the mountain:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	39	Where they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and, behold,there was much ado and great carriage: and the bridegroom cameforth, and his friends and brethren, to meet them with drums,and instruments of musick, and many weapons.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	40	Then Jonathan and they that were with him rose up againstthem from the place where they lay in ambush, and made aslaughter of them in such sort, as many fell down dead, and theremnant fled into the mountain, and they took all their spoils.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	41	Thus was the marriage turned into mourning, and the noise oftheir melody into lamentation.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	42	So when they had avenged fully the blood of their brother,they turned again to the marsh of Jordan.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	43	Now when Bacchides heard hereof, he came on the sabbath dayunto the banks of Jordan with a great power.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	44	Then Jonathan said to his company, Let us go up now and fightfor our lives, for it standeth not with us to day, as in timepast:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	45	For, behold, the battle is before us and behind us, and thewater of Jordan on this side and that side, the marsh likewiseand wood, neither is there place for us to turn aside.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	46	Wherefore cry ye now unto heaven, that ye may be deliveredfrom the hand of your enemies.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	47	With that they joined battle, and Jonathan stretched forthhis hand to smite Bacchides, but he turned back from him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	48	Then Jonathan and they that were with him leapt into Jordan,and swam over unto the other bank: howbeit the other passed notover Jordan unto them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	49	So there were slain of Bacchides' side that day about athousand men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	50	Afterward returned Bacchides to Jerusalem and repaired thestrong cites in Judea; the fort in Jericho, and Emmaus, andBethhoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon,these did he strengthen with high walls, with gates and withbars.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	51	And in them he set a garrison, that they might work maliceupon Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	52	He fortified also the city Bethsura, and Gazera, and thetower, and put forces in them, and provision of victuals.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	53	Besides, he took the chief men's sons in the country forhostages, and put them into the tower at Jerusalem to be kept.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	54	Moreover in the hundred fifty and third year, in the secondmonth, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of thesanctuary should be pulled down; he pulled down also the worksof the prophets
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	55	And as he began to pull down, even at that time was Alcimusplagued, and his enterprizes hindered: for his mouth wasstopped, and he was taken with a palsy, so that he could no morespeak any thing, nor give order concerning his house.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	56	So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	57	Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned tothe king: whereupon the land of Judea was in rest two years.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	58	Then all the ungodly men held a council, saying, Behold,Jonathan and his company are at ease, and dwell without care:now therefore we will bring Bacchides hither, who shall takethem all in one night.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	59	So they went and consulted with him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	60	Then removed he, and came with a great host, and sent lettersprivily to his adherents in Judea, that they should takeJonathan and those that were with him: howbeit they could not,because their counsel was known unto them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	61	Wherefore they took of the men of the country, that wereauthors of that mischief, about fifty persons, and slew them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	62	Afterward Jonathan, and Simon, and they that were with him,got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wilderness, and theyrepaired the decays thereof, and made it strong.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	63	Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all hishost, and sent word to them that were of Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	64	Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi; and they foughtagainst it a long season and made engines of war.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	65	But Jonathan left his brother Simon in the city, and wentforth himself into the country, and with a certain number wenthe forth.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	66	And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children ofPhasiron in their tent.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	67	And when he began to smite them, and came up with his forces,Simon and his company went out of the city, and burned up theengines of war,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	68	And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them,and they afflicted him sore: for his counsel and travail was invain.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	69	Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gave himcounsel to come into the country, inasmuch as he slew many ofthem, and purposed to return into his own country.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	70	Whereof when Jonathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadors untohim, to the end he should make peace with him, and deliver themthe prisoners.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	71	Which thing he accepted, and did according to his demands,and sware unto him that he would never do him harm all the daysof his life.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	72	When therefore he had restored unto him the prisoners that hehad taken aforetime out of the land of Judea, he returned andwent his way into his own land, neither came he any more intotheir borders.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	9	73	Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Jonathan dwelt atMachmas, and began to govern the people; and he destroyed theungodly men out of Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	1	In the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander, the son ofAntiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went up and took Ptolemais: forthe people had received him, by means whereof he reigned there,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	2	Now when king Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered togetheran exceeding great host, and went forth against him to fight.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	3	Moreover Demetrius sent letters unto Jonathan with lovingwords, so as he magnified him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	4	For said he, Let us first make peace with him, before he joinwith Alexander against us:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	5	Else he will remember all the evils that we have done againsthim, and against his brethren and his people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	6	Wherefore he gave him authority to gather together an host,and to provide weapons, that he might aid him in battle: hecommanded also that the hostages that were in the tower shouldbe delivered him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	7	Then came Jonathan to Jerusalem, and read the letters in theaudience of all the people, and of them that were in the tower:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	8	Who were sore afraid, when they heard that the king had givenhim authority to gather together an host.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	9	Whereupon they of the tower delivered their hostages untoJonathan, and he delivered them unto their parents.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	10	This done, Jonathan settled himself in Jerusalem, and beganto build and repair the city.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	11	And he commanded the workmen to build the walls and the mountSion and about with square stones for fortification; and theydid so.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	12	Then the strangers, that were in the fortresses whichBacchides had built, fled away;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	13	Insomuch as every man left his place, and went into his owncountry.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	14	Only at Bethsura certain of those that had forsaken the lawand the commandments remained still: for it was their place ofrefuge.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	15	Now when king Alexander had heard what promises Demetrius hadsent unto Jonathan: when also it was told him of the battles andnoble acts which he and his brethren had done, and of the painsthat they had endured,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	16	He said, Shall we find such another man? now therefore wewill make him our friend and confederate.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	17	Upon this he wrote a letter, and sent it unto him, accordingto these words, saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	18	King Alexander to his brother Jonathan sendeth greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	19	We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power,and meet to be our friend.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	20	Wherefore now this day we ordain thee to be the high priestof thy nation, and to be called the king's friend; (andtherewithal he sent him a purple robe and a crown of gold:) andrequire thee to take our part, and keep friendship with us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	21	So in the seventh month of the hundred and sixtieth year, atthe feast of the tabernacles, Jonathan put on the holy robe, andgathered together forces, and provided much armour.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	22	Whereof when Demetrius heard, he was very sorry, and said,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	23	What have we done, that Alexander hath prevented us in makingamity with the Jews to strengthen himself?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	24	I also will write unto them words of encouragement, andpromise them dignities and gifts, that I may have their aid.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	25	He sent unto them therefore to this effect: King Demetriusunto the people of the Jews sendeth greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	26	Whereas ye have kept covenants with us, and continued in ourfriendship, not joining yourselves with our enemies, we haveheard hereof, and are glad.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	27	Wherefore now continue ye still to be faithful unto us, andwe will well recompense you for the things ye do in our behalf,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	28	And will grant you many immunities, and give you rewards.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	29	And now do I free you, and for your sake I release all theJews, from tributes, and from the customs of salt, and fromcrown taxes,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	30	And from that which appertaineth unto me to receive for thethird part or the seed, and the half of the fruit of the trees,I release it from this day forth, so that they shall not betaken of the land of Judea, nor of the three governments whichare added thereunto out of the country of Samaria and Galilee,from this day forth for evermore.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	31	Let Jerusalem also be holy and free, with the bordersthereof, both from tenths and tributes.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	32	And as for the tower which is at Jerusalem, I yield upauthority over it, and give the high priest, that he may set init such men as he shall choose to keep it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	33	Moreover I freely set at liberty every one of the Jews, thatwere carried captives out of the land of Judea into any part ofmy kingdom, and I will that all my officers remit the tributeseven of their cattle.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	34	Furthermore I will that all the feasts, and sabbaths, and newmoons, and solemn days, and the three days before the feast, andthe three days after the feast shall be all of immunity andfreedom for all the Jews in my realm.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	35	Also no man shall have authority to meddle with or to molestany of them in any matter.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	36	I will further, that there be enrolled among the king'sforces about thirty thousand men of the Jews, unto whom payshall be given, as belongeth to all king's forces.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	37	And of them some shall be placed in the king's strong holds,of whom also some shall be set over the affairs of the kingdom,which are of trust: and I will that their overseers andgovernors be of themselves, and that they live after their ownlaws, even as the king hath commanded in the land of Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	38	And concerning the three governments that are added to Judeafrom the country of Samaria, let them be joined with Judea, thatthey may be reckoned to be under one, nor bound to obey otherauthority than the high priest's.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	39	As for Ptolemais, and the land pertaining thereto, I give itas a free gift to the sanctuary at Jerusalem for the necessaryexpences of the sanctuary.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	40	Moreover I give every year fifteen thousand shekels of silverout of the king's accounts from the places appertaining.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	41	And all the overplus, which the officers payed not in as informer time, from henceforth shall be given toward the works ofthe temple.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	42	And beside this, the five thousand shekels of silver, whichthey took from the uses of the temple out of the accounts yearby year, even those things shall be released, because theyappertain to the priests that minister.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	43	And whosoever they be that flee unto the temple at Jerusalem,or be within the liberties hereof, being indebted unto the king,or for any other matter, let them be at liberty, and all thatthey have in my realm.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	44	For the building also and repairing of the works of thesanctuary expences shall be given of the king's accounts.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	45	Yea, and for the building of the walls of Jerusalem, and thefortifying thereof round about, expences shall be given out ofthe king's accounts, as also for the building of the walls inJudea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	46	Now when Jonathan and the people heard these words, they gaveno credit unto them, nor received them, because they rememberedthe great evil that he had done in Israel; for he had afflictedthem very sore.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	47	But with Alexander they were well pleased, because he was thefirst that entreated of true peace with them, and they wereconfederate with him always.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	48	Then gathered king Alexander great forces, and camped overagainst Demetrius.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	49	And after the two kings had joined battle, Demetrius' hostfled: but Alexander followed after him, and prevailed againstthem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	50	And he continued the battle very sore until the sun wentdown: and that day was Demetrius slain.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	51	Afterward Alexander sent ambassadors to Ptolemee king ofEgypt with a message to this effect:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	52	Forasmuch as I am come again to my realm, and am set in thethrone of my progenitors, and have gotten the dominion, andoverthrown Demetrius, and recovered our country;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	53	For after I had joined battle with him, both he and his hostwas discomfited by us, so that we sit in the throne of hiskingdom:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	54	Now therefore let us make a league of amity together, andgive me now thy daughter to wife: and I will be thy son in law,and will give both thee and her as according to thy dignity.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	55	Then Ptolemee the king gave answer, saying, Happy be the daywherein thou didst return into the land of thy fathers, andsatest in the throne of their kingdom.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	56	And now will I do to thee, as thou hast written: meet metherefore at Ptolemais, that we may see one another; for I willmarry my daughter to thee according to thy desire.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	57	So Ptolemee went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra,and they came unto Ptolemais in the hundred threescore andsecond year:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	58	Where king Alexander meeting him, he gave unto him hisdaughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemaiswith great glory, as the manner of kings is.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	59	Now king Alexander had written unto Jonathan, that he shouldcome and meet him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	60	Who thereupon went honourably to Ptolemais, where he met thetwo kings, and gave them and their friends silver and gold, andmany presents, and found favour in their sight.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	61	At that time certain pestilent fellows of Israel, men of awicked life, assembled themselves against him, to accuse him:but the king would not hear them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	62	Yea more than that, the king commanded to take off hisgarments, and clothe him in purple: and they did so.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	63	And he made him sit by himself, and said into his princes, Gowith him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, thatno man complain against him of any matter, and that no mantrouble him for any manner of cause.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	64	Now when his accusers saw that he was honored according tothe proclamation, and clothed in purple, they fled all away.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	65	So the king honoured him, and wrote him among his chieffriends, and made him a duke, and partaker of his dominion.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	66	Afterward Jonathan returned to Jerusalem with peace andgladness.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	67	Furthermore in the; hundred threescore and fifth year cameDemetrius son of Demetrius out of Crete into the land of hisfathers:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	68	Whereof when king Alexander heard tell, he was right sorry,and returned into Antioch.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	69	Then Demetrius made Apollonius the governor of Celosyria hisgeneral, who gathered together a great host, and camped inJamnia, and sent unto Jonathan the high priest, saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	70	Thou alone liftest up thyself against us, and I am laughed toscorn for thy sake, and reproached: and why dost thou vaunt thypower against us in the mountains?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	71	Now therefore, if thou trustest in thine own strength, comedown to us into the plain field, and there let us try the mattertogether: for with me is the power of the cities.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	72	Ask and learn who I am, and the rest that take our part, andthey shall tell thee that thy foot is not able to to flight intheir own land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	73	Wherefore now thou shalt not be able to abide the horsemenand so great a power in the plain, where is neither stone norflint, nor place to flee unto.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	74	So when Jonathan heard these words of Apollonius, he wasmoved in his mind, and choosing ten thousand men he went out ofJerusalem, where Simon his brother met him for to help him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	75	And he pitched his tents against Joppa: but; they of Joppashut him out of the city, because Apollonius had a garrisonthere.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	76	Then Jonathan laid siege unto it: whereupon they of the citylet him in for fear: and so Jonathan won Joppa.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	77	Whereof when Apollonius heard, he took three thousandhorsemen, with a great host of footmen, and went to Azotus asone that journeyed, and therewithal drew him forth into theplain. because he had a great number of horsemen, in whom he puthis trust.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	78	Then Jonathan followed after him to Azotus, where the armiesjoined battle.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	79	Now Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in ambush.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	80	And Jonathan knew that there was an ambushment behind him;for they had compassed in his host, and cast darts at thepeople, from morning till evening.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	81	But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them:and so the enemies' horses were tired.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	82	Then brought Simon forth his host, and set them against thefootmen, (for the horsemen were spent) who were discomfited byhim, and fled.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	83	The horsemen also, being scattered in the field, fled toAzotus, and went into Bethdagon, their idol's temple, forsafety.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	84	But Jonathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round aboutit, and took their spoils; and the temple of Dagon, with themthat were fled into it, he burned with fire.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	85	Thus there were burned and slain with the sword well nigheight thousand men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	86	And from thence Jonathan removed his host, and camped againstAscalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him withgreat pomp.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	87	After this returned Jonathan and his host unto Jerusalem,having any spoils.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	88	Now when king ALexander heard these things, he honouredJonathan yet more.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	10	89	And sent him a buckle of gold, as the use is to be given tosuch as are of the king's blood: he gave him also Accaron withthe borders thereof in possession.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	1	And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host, likethe sand that lieth upon the sea shore, and many ships, and wentabout through deceit to get Alexander's kingdom, and join it tohis own.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	2	Whereupon he took his journey into Spain in peaceable manner,so as they of the cities opened unto him, and met him: for kingAlexander had commanded them so to do, because he was hisbrother in law.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	3	Now as Ptolemee entered into the cities, he set in every oneof them a garrison of soldiers to keep it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	4	And when he came near to Azotus, they shewed him the templeof Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus and the suburbs thereof thatwere destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad and themthat he had burnt in the battle; for they had made heaps of themby the way where he should pass.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	5	Also they told the king whatsoever Jonathan had done, to theintent he might blame him: but the king held his peace.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	6	Then Jonathan met the king with great pomp at Joppa, wherethey saluted one another, and lodged.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	7	Afterward Jonathan, when he had gone with the king to theriver called Eleutherus, returned again to Jerusalem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	8	King Ptolemee therefore, having gotten the dominion of thecities by the sea unto Seleucia upon the sea coast, imaginedwicked counsels against Alexander.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	9	Whereupon he sent ambasadors unto king Demetrius, saying,Come, let us make a league betwixt us, and I will give thee mydaughter whom Alexander hath, and thou shalt reign in thyfather's kingdom:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	10	For I repent that I gave my daughter unto him, for he soughtto slay me.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	11	Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of hiskingdom.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	12	Wherefore he took his daughter from him, and gave her toDemetrius, and forsook Alexander, so that their hatred wasopenly known.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	13	Then Ptolemee entered into Antioch, where he set two crownsupon his head, the crown of Asia, and of Egypt.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	14	In the mean season was king Alexander in Cilicia, becausethose that dwelt in those parts had revolted from him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	15	But when Alexander heard of this, he came to war against him:whereupon king Ptolemee brought forth his host, and met him witha mighty power, and put him to flight.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	16	So Alexander fled into Arabia there to be defended; but kingPtolemee was exalted:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	17	For Zabdiel the Arabian took off Alexander's head, and sentit unto Ptolemee.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	18	King Ptolemee also died the third day after, and they thatwere in the strong holds were slain one of another.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	19	By this means Demetrius reigned in the hundred threescore andseventh year.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	20	At the same time Jonathan gathered together them that were inJudea to take the tower that was in Jerusalem: and he made manyengines of war against it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	21	Then came ungodly persons, who hated their own people, wentunto the king, and told him that Jonathan besieged the tower,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	22	Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediatelyremoving, he came to Ptolemais, and wrote unto Jonathan, that heshould not lay siege to the tower, but come and speak with himat Ptolemais in great haste.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	23	Nevertheless Jonathan, when he heard this, commanded tobesiege it still: and he chose certain of the elders of Israeland the priests, and put himself in peril;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	24	And took silver and gold, and raiment, and divers presentsbesides, and went to Ptolemais unto the king, where he foundfavour in his sight.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	25	And though certain ungodly men of the people had madecomplaints against him,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	26	Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had donebefore, and promoted him in the sight of all his friends,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	27	And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all thehonours that he had before, and gave him preeminence among hischief friends.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	28	Then Jonathan desired the king, that he would make Judea freefrom tribute, as also the three governments, with the country ofSamaria; and he promised him three hundred talents.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	29	So the king consented, and wrote letters unto Jonathan of allthese things after this manner:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	30	King Demetrius unto his brother Jonathan, and unto the nationof the Jews, sendeth greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	31	We send you here a copy of the letter which we did write untoour cousin Lasthenes concerning you, that ye might see it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	32	King Demetrius unto his father Lasthenes sendeth greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	33	We are determined to do good to the people of the Jews, whoare our friends, and keep covenants with us, because of theirgood will toward us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	34	Wherefore we have ratified unto them the borders of Judea,with the three governments of Apherema and Lydda and Ramathem,that are added unto Judea from the country of Samaria, and allthings appertaining unto them, for all such as do sacrifice inJerusalem, instead of the payments which the king received ofthem yearly aforetime out of the fruits of the earth and oftrees.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	35	And as for other things that belong unto us, of the tithesand customs pertaining unto us, as also the saltpits, and thecrown taxes, which are due unto us, we discharge them of themall for their relief.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	36	And nothing hereof shall be revoked from this time forth forever.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	37	Now therefore see that thou make a copy of these things, andlet it be delivered unto Jonathan, and set upon the holy mountin a conspicuous place.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	38	After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quietbefore him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sentaway all his forces, every one to his own place, except certainbands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the isles of theheathen: wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	39	Moreover there was one Tryphon, that had been of Alexander'spart afore, who, seeing that all the host murmured againstDemetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian that brought upAntiochus the young son of Alexander,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	40	And lay sore upon him to deliver him this young Antiochus,that he might reign in his father's stead: he told him thereforeall that Demetrius had done, and how his men of war were atenmity with him, and there he remained a long season.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	41	In the mean time Jonathan sent unto king Demetrius, that hewould cast those of the tower out of Jerusalem, and those alsoin the fortresses: for they fought against Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	42	So Demetrius sent unto Jonathan, saying, I will not only dothis for thee and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee andthy nation, if opportunity serve.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	43	Now therefore thou shalt do well, if thou send me men to helpme; for all my forces are gone from me.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	44	Upon this Jonathan sent him three thousand strong men untoAntioch: and when they came to the king, the king was very gladof their coming.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	45	Howbeit they that were of the city gathered themselvestogether into the midst of the city, to the number of an hundredand twenty thousand men, and would have slain the king.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	46	Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the citykept the passages of the city, and began to fight.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	47	Then the king called to the Jews for help, who came unto himall at once, and dispersing themselves through the city slewthat day in the city to the number of an hundred thousand.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	48	Also they set fire on the city, and gat many spoils that day,and delivered the king.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	49	So when they of the city saw that the Jews had got the cityas they would, their courage was abated: wherefore they madesupplication to the king, and cried, saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	50	Grant us peace, and let the Jews cease from assaulting us andthe city.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	51	With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace; andthe Jews were honoured in the sight of the king, and in thesight of all that were in his realm; and they returned toJerusalem, having great spoils.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	52	So king Demetrius sat on the throne of his kingdom, and theland was quiet before him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	53	Nevertheless he dissembled in all that ever he spake, andestranged himself from Jonathan, neither rewarded he himaccording to the benefits which he had received of him, buttroubled him very sore.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	54	After this returned Tryphon, and with him the young childAntiochus, who reigned, and was crowned.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	55	Then there gathered unto him all the men of war, whomDemetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, whoturned his back and fled.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	56	Moreover Tryphon took the elephants, and won Antioch.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	57	At that time young Antiochus wrote unto Jonathan, saying, Iconfirm thee in the high priesthood, and appoint thee ruler overthe four governments, and to be one of the king's friends.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	58	Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be served in, andgave him leave to drink in gold, and to be clothed in purple,and to wear a golden buckle.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	59	His brother Simon also he made captain from the place calledThe ladder of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	60	Then Jonathan went forth, and passed through the citiesbeyond the water, and all the forces of Syria gatheredthemselves unto him for to help him: and when he came toAscalon, they of the city met him honourably.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	61	From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out;wherefore he laid siege unto it, and burned the suburbs thereofwith fire, and spoiled them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	62	Afterward, when they of Gaza made supplication unto Jonathan,he made peace with them, and took the sons of their chief menfor hostages, and sent them to Jerusalem, and passed through thecountry unto Damascus.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	63	Now when Jonathan heard that Demetrius' princes were come toCades, which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing toremove him out of the country,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	64	He went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in thecountry.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	65	Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it along season, and shut it up:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	66	But they desired to have peace with him, which he grantedthem, and then put them out from thence, and took the city, andset a garrison in it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	67	As for Jonathan and his host, they pitched at the water ofGennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gat them tothe plain of Nasor.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	68	And, behold, the host of strangers met them in the plain,who, having laid men in ambush for him in the mountains, camethemselves over against him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	69	So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places andjoined battle, all that were of Jonathan's side fled;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	70	Insomuch as there was not one of them left, except Mattathiasthe son of Absalom, and Judas the son of Calphi, the captains ofthe host.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	71	Then Jonathan rent his clothes, and cast earth upon his head,and prayed.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	72	Afterwards turning again to battle, he put them to flight,and so they ran away.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	73	Now when his own men that were fled saw this, they turnedagain unto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, even untotheir own tents, and there they camped.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	11	74	So there were slain of the heathen that day about threethousand men: but Jonathan returned to Jerusalem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	1	Now when Jonathan saw that time served him, he chose certainmen, and sent them to Rome, for to confirm and renew thefriendship that they had with them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	2	He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to otherplaces, for the same purpose.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	3	So they went unto Rome, and entered into the senate, andsaid, Jonathan the high priest, and the people of the Jews, sentus unto you, to the end ye should renew the friendship, which yehad with them, and league, as in former time.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	4	Upon this the Romans gave them letters unto the governors ofevery place that they should bring them into the land of Judeapeaceably.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	5	And this is the copy of the letters which Jonathan wrote tothe Lacedemonians:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	6	Jonathan the high priest, and the elders of the nation, andthe priests, and the other of the Jews, unto the Lacedemonianstheir brethren send greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	7	There were letters sent in times past unto Onias the highpriest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signify thatye are our brethren, as the copy here underwritten doth specify.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	8	At which time Onias entreated the ambassador that was senthonourably, and received the letters, wherein declaration wasmade of the league and friendship.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	9	Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, thatwe have the holy books of scripture in our hands to comfort us,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	10	Have nevertheless attempted to send unto you for the renewingof brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangersunto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since yesent unto us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	11	We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in ourfeasts, and other convenient days, do remember you in thesacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, andas it becometh us to think upon our brethren:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	12	And we are right glad of your honour.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	13	As for ourselves, we have had great troubles and wars onevery side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about us havefought against us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	14	Howbeit we would not be troublesome unto you, nor to othersof our confederates and friends, in these wars:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	15	For we have help from heaven that succoureth us, so as we aredelivered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought underfoot.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	16	For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, andAntipater he son of Jason, and sent them unto the Romans, torenew the amity that we had with them, and the former league.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	17	We commanded them also to go unto you, and to salute and todeliver you our letters concerning the renewing of ourbrotherhood.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	18	Wherefore now ye shall do well to give us an answer thereto.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	19	And this is the copy of the letters which Oniares sent.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	20	Areus king of the Lacedemonians to Onias the high priest,greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	21	It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Jews arebrethren, and that they are of the stock of Abraham:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	22	Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, ye shalldo well to write unto us of your prosperity.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	23	We do write back again to you, that your cattle and goods areour's, and our's are your's We do command therefore ourambassadors to make report unto you on this wise.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	24	Now when Jonathan heard that Demebius' princes were come tofight against him with a greater host than afore,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	25	He removed from Jerusalem, and met them in the land ofAmathis: for he gave them no respite to enter his country.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	26	He sent spies also unto their tents, who came again, and toldhim that they were appointed to come upon them in the nightseason.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	27	Wherefore so soon as the sun was down, Jonathan commanded hismen to watch, and to be in arms, that all the night long theymight be ready to fight: also he sent forth centinels roundabout the host.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	28	But when the adversaries heard that Jonathan and his men wereready for battle, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, andthey kindled fires in their camp.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	29	Howbeit Jonathan and his company knew it not till themorning: for they saw the lights burning.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	30	Then Jonathan pursued after them, but overtook them not: forthey were gone over the river Eleutherus.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	31	Wherefore Jonathan turned to the Arabians, who were calledZabadeans, and smote them, and took their spoils.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	32	And removing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passedthrough all the country,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	33	Simon also went forth, and passed through the country untoAscalon, and the holds there adjoining, from whence he turnedaside to Joppa, and won it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	34	For he had heard that they would deliver the hold unto themthat took Demetrius' part; wherefore he set a garrison there tokeep it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	35	After this came Jonathan home again, and calling the eldersof the people together, he consulted with them about buildingstrong holds in Judea,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	36	And making the walls of Jerusalem higher, and raising a greatmount between the tower and the city, for to separate it fromthe city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sellnor buy in it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	37	Upon this they came together to build up the city, forasmuchas part of the wall toward the brook on the east side was fallendown, and they repaired that which was called Caphenatha.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	38	Simon also set up Adida in Sephela, and made it strong withgates and bars.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	39	Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdom of Asia, and tokill Antiochus the king, that he might set the crown upon hisown head.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	40	Howbeit he was afraid that Jonathan would not suffer him, andthat he would fight against him; wherefore he sought a way howto take Jonathan, that he might kill him. So he removed, andcame to Bethsan.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	41	Then Jonathan went out to meet him with forty thousand menchosen for the battle, and came to Bethsan.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	42	Now when Tryphon saw Jonathan came with so great a force, hedurst not stretch his hand against him;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	43	But received him honourably, and commended him unto all hisfriends, and gave him gifts, and commanded his men of war to beas obedient unto him, as to himself.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	44	Unto Jonathan also he said, Why hast thou brought all thispeople to so great trouble, seeing there is no war betwixt us?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	45	Therefore send them now home again, and choose a few men towait on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I willgive it thee, and the rest of the strong holds and forces, andall that have any charge: as for me, I will return and depart:for this is the cause of my coming.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	46	So Jonathan believing him did as he bade him, and sent awayhis host, who went into the land of Judea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	47	And with himself he retained but three thousand men, of whomhe sent two thousand into Galilee, and one thousand went withhim.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	48	Now as soon as Jonathan entered into Ptolemais, they ofPtolemais shut the gates and took him, and all them that camewith him they slew with the sword.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	49	Then sent Tryphon an host of footmen and horsemen intoGalilee, and into the great plain, to destroy all Jonathan'scompany.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	50	But when they knew that Jonathan and they that were with himwere taken and slain, they encouraged one another; and wentclose together, prepared to fight.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	51	They therefore that followed upon them, perceiving that theywere ready to fight for their lives, turned back again.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	52	Whereupon they all came into the land of Judea peaceably, andthere they bewailed Jonathan, and them that were with him, andthey were sore afraid; wherefore all Israel made greatlamentation.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	12	53	Then all the heathen that were round about then sought todestroy them: for said they, They have no captain, nor any tohelp them: now therefore let us make war upon them, and takeaway their memorial from among men.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	1	Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together agreat host to invade the land of Judea, and destroy it,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	2	And saw that the people was in great trembling and fear, hewent up to Jerusalem, and gathered the people together,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	3	And gave them exhortation, saying, Ye yourselves know whatgreat things I, and my brethren, and my father's house, havedone for the laws and the sanctuary, the battles also andtroubles which we have seen.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	4	By reason whereof all my brethren are slain for Israel'ssake, and I am left alone.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	5	Now therefore be it far from me, that I should spare mine ownlife in any time of trouble: for I am no better than mybrethren.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	6	Doubtless I will avenge my nation, and the sanctuary, and ourwives, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered todestroy us of very malice.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	7	Now as soon as the people heard these words, their spiritrevived.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	8	And they answered with a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt beour leader instead of Judas and Jonathan thy brother.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	9	Fight thou our battles, and whatsoever, thou commandest us,that will we do.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	10	So then he gathered together all the men of war, and madehaste to finish the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified itround about.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	11	Also he sent Jonathan the son of Absolom, and with him agreat power, to Joppa: who casting out them that were thereinremained there in it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	12	So Tryphon removed from Ptolemaus with a great power toinvade the land of Judea, and Jonathan was with him in ward.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	13	But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, over against the plain.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	14	Now when Tryphon knew that Simon was risen up instead of hisbrother Jonathan, and meant to join battle with him, he sentmessengers unto him, saying,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	15	Whereas we have Jonathan thy brother in hold, it is for moneythat he is owing unto the king's treasure, concerning thebusiness that was committed unto him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	16	Wherefore now send an hundred talents of silver, and two ofhis sons for hostages, that when he is at liberty he may notrevolt from us, and we will let him go.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	17	Hereupon Simon, albeit he perceived that they spakedeceitfully unto him yet sent he the money and the children,lest peradventure he should procure to himself great hatred ofthe people:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	18	Who might have said, Because I sent him not the money and thechildren, therefore is Jonathan dead.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	19	So he sent them the children and the hundred talents: howbeitTryphon dissembled neither would he let Jonathan go.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	20	And after this came Tryphon to invade the land, and destroyit, going round about by the way that leadeth unto Adora: butSimon and his host marched against him in every place,wheresoever he went.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	21	Now they that were in the tower sent messengers unto Tryphon,to the end that he should hasten his coming unto them by thewilderness, and send them victuals.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	22	Wherefore Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come thatnight: but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof hecame not. So he departed, and came into the country of Galaad.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	23	And when he came near to Bascama he slew Jonathan, who wasburied there.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	24	Afterward Tryphon returned and went into his own land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	25	Then sent Simon, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother,and buried them in Modin, the city of his fathers.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	26	And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailedhim many days.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	27	Simon also built a monument upon the sepulchre of his fatherand his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewnstone behind and before.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	28	Moreover he set up seven pyramids, one against another, forhis father, and his mother, and his four brethren.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	29	And in these he made cunning devices, about the which he setgreat pillars, and upon the pillars he made all their armour fora perpetual memory, and by the armour ships carved, that theymight be seen of all that sail on the sea.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	30	This is the sepulchre which he made at Modin, and it standethyet unto this day.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	31	Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the young king Antiochus,and slew him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	32	And he reigned in his stead, and crowned himself king ofAsia, and brought a great calamity upon the land.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	33	Then Simon built up the strong holds in Judea, and fencedthem about with high towers, and great walls, and gates, andbars, and laid up victuals therein.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	34	Moreover Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to theend he should give the land an immunity, because all thatTryphon did was to spoil.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	35	Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote after thismanner:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	36	King Demetrius unto Simon the high priest, and friend ofkings, as also unto the elders and nation of the Jews, sendethgreeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	37	The golden crown, and the scarlet robe, which ye sent untous, we have received: and we are ready to make a stedfast peacewith you, yea, and to write unto our officers, to confirm theimmunities which we have granted.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	38	And whatsoever covenants we have made with you shall stand;and the strong holds, which ye have builded, shall be your own.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	39	As for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, weforgive it, and the crown tax also, which ye owe us: and ifthere were any other tribute paid in Jerusalem, it shall no morebe paid.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	40	And look who are meet among you to be in our court, let thenbe enrolled, and let there be peace betwixt us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	41	Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel inthe hundred and seventieth year.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	42	Then the people of Israel began to write in their instrumentsand contracts, In the first year of Simon the high priest, thegovernor and leader of the Jews.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	43	In those days Simon camped against Gaza and besieged it roundabout; he made also an engine of war, and set it by the city,and battered a certain tower, and took it.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	44	And they that were in the engine leaped into the city;whereupon there was a great uproar in the city:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	45	Insomuch as the people of the city rent their clothes, andclimbed upon the walls with their wives and children, and criedwith a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	46	And they said, Deal not with us according to our wickedness,but according to thy mercy.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	47	So Simon was appeased toward them, and fought no more againstthem, but put them out of the city, and cleansed the houseswherein the idols were, and so entered into it with songs andthanksgiving.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	48	Yea, he put all uncleanness out of it, and placed such menthere as would keep the law, and made it stronger than it wasbefore, and built therein a dwellingplace for himself.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	49	They also of the tower in Jerusalem were kept so strait, thatthey could neither come forth, nor go into the country, nor buy,nor sell: wherefore they were in great distress for want ofvictuals, and a great number of them perished through famine.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	50	Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to be at one withthem: which thing he granted them; and when he had put them outfrom thence, he cleansed the tower from pollutions:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	51	And entered into it the three and twentieth day of the secondmonth in the hundred seventy and first year, with thanksgiving,and branches of palm trees, and with harps, and cymbals, andwith viols, and hymns, and songs: because there was destroyed agreat enemy out of Israel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	52	He ordained also that that day should be kept every year withgladness. Moreover the hill of the temple that was by the towerhe made stronger than it was, and there he dwelt himself withhis company.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	13	53	And when Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man, hemade him captain of all the hosts; and he dwelt in Gazera.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	1	Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth year king Demetriusgathered his forces together, and went into Media to get himhelp to fight against Tryphone.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	2	But when Arsaces, the king of Persia and Media, heard thatDemetrius was entered within his borders, he sent one of hisprinces to take him alive:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	3	Who went and smote the host of Demetrius, and took him, andbrought him to Arsaces, by whom he was put in ward.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	4	As for the land of Judea, that was quiet all the days ofSimon; for he sought the good of his nation in such wise, asthat evermore his authority and honour pleased them well.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	5	And as he was honourable in all his acts, so in this, that hetook Joppa for an haven, and made an entrance to the isles ofthe sea,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	6	And enlarged the bounds of his nation, and recovered thecountry,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	7	And gathered together a great number of captives, and had thedominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower, out of thewhich he took all uncleaness, neither was there any thatresisted him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	8	Then did they till their ground in peace, and the earth gaveher increase, and the trees of the field their fruit.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	9	The ancient men sat all in the streets, communing together ofgood things, and the young men put on glorious and warlikeapparel.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	10	He provided victuals for the cities, and set in them allmanner of munition, so that his honourable name was renownedunto the end of the world.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	11	He made peace in the land, and Israel rejoiced with greatjoy:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	12	For every man sat under his vine and his fig tree, and therewas none to fray them:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	13	Neither was there any left in the land to fight against them:yea, the kings themselves were overthrown in those days.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	14	Moreover he strengthened all those of his people that werebrought low: the law he searched out; and every contemner of thelaw and wicked person he took away.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	15	He beautified the sanctuary, and multiplied vessels of thetemple.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	16	Now when it was heard at Rome, and as far as Sparta, thatJonathan was dead, they were very sorry.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	17	But as soon as they heard that his brother Simon was madehigh priest in his stead, and ruled the country, and the citiestherein:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	18	They wrote unto him in tables of brass, to renew thefriendship and league which they had made with Judas andJonathan his brethren:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	19	Which writings were read before the congregation atJerusalem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	20	And this is the copy of the letters that the Lacedemonianssent; The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, unto Simonthe high priest, and the elders, and priests, and residue of thepeople of the Jews, our brethren, send greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	21	The ambassadors that were sent unto our people certified usof your glory and honour: wherefore we were glad of theircoming,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	22	And did register the things that they spake in the council ofthe people in this manner; Numenius son of Antiochus, andAntipater son of Jason, the Jews' ambassadors, came unto us torenew the friendship they had with us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	23	And it pleased the people to entertain the men honourably,and to put the copy of their ambassage in publick records, tothe end the people of the Lacedemonians might have a memorialthereof: furthermore we have written a copy thereof unto Simonthe high priest.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	24	After this Simon sent Numenius to Rome with a great shield ofgold of a thousand pound weight to confirm the league with them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	25	Whereof when the people heard, they said, What thanks shallwe give to Simon and his sons?
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	26	For he and his brethren and the house of his father haveestablished Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies fromthem, and confirmed their liberty.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	27	So then they wrote it in tables of brass, which they set uponpillars in mount Sion: and this is the copy of the writing; Theeighteenth day of the month Elul, in the hundred threescore andtwelfth year, being the third year of Simon the high priest,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	28	At Saramel in the great congregation of the priests, andpeople, and rulers of the nation, and elders of the country,were these things notified unto us.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	29	Forasmuch as oftentimes there have been wars in the country,wherein for the maintenance of their sanctuary, and the law,Simon the son of Mattathias, of the posterity of Jarib, togetherwith his brethren, put themselves in jeopardy, and resisting theenemies of their nation did their nation great honour:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	30	(For after that Jonathan, having gathered his nationtogether, and been their high priest, was added to his people,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	31	Their enemies prepared to invade their country, that theymight destroy it, and lay hands on the sanctuary:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	32	At which time Simon rose up, and fought for his nation, andspent much of his own substance, and armed the valiant men ofhis nation and gave them wages,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	33	And fortified the cities of Judea, together with Bethsura,that lieth upon the borders of Judea, where the armour of theenemies had been before; but he set a garrison of Jews there:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	34	Moreover he fortified Joppa, which lieth upon the sea, andGazera, that bordereth upon Azotus, where the enemies had dweltbefore: but he placed Jews there, and furnished them with allthings convenient for the reparation thereof.)
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	35	The people therefore sang the acts of Simon, and unto whatglory he thought to bring his nation, made him their governorand chief priest, because he had done all these things, and forthe justice and faith which he kept to his nation, and for thathe sought by all means to exalt his people.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	36	For in his time things prospered in his hands, so that theheathen were taken out of their country, and they also that werein the city of David in Jerusalem, who had made themselves atower, out of which they issued, and polluted all about thesanctuary, and did much hurt in the holy place:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	37	But he placed Jews therein. and fortified it for the safetyof the country and the city, and raised up the walls ofJerusalem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	38	King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high priesthoodaccording to those things,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	39	And made him one of his friends, and honoured him with greathonour.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	40	For he had heard say, that the Romans had called the Jewstheir friends and confederates and brethren; and that they hadentertained the ambassadors of Simon honourably;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	41	Also that the Jews and priests were well pleased that Simonshould be their governor and high priest for ever, until thereshould arise a faithful prophet;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	42	Moreover that he should be their captain, and should takecharge of the sanctuary, to set them over their works, and overthe country, and over the armour, and over the fortresses, that,I say, he should take charge of the sanctuary;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	43	Beside this, that he should be obeyed of every man, and thatall the writings in the country should be made in his name, andthat he should be clothed in purple, and wear gold:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	44	Also that it should be lawful for none of the people orpriests to break any of these things, or to gainsay his words,or to gather an assembly in the country without him, or to beclothed in purple, or wear a buckle of gold;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	45	And whosoever should do otherwise, or break any of thesethings, he should be punished.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	46	Thus it liked all the people to deal with Simon, and to do ashath been said.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	47	Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be highpriest, and captain and governor of the Jews and priests, and todefend them all.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	48	So they commanded that this writing should be put in tablesof brass, and that they should be set up within the compass ofthe sanctuary in a conspicuous place;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	14	49	Also that the copies thereof should be laid up in thetreasury, to the end that Simon and his sons might have them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	1	Moreover Antiochus son of Demetrius the king sent lettersfrom the isles of the sea unto Simon the priest and prince ofthe Jews, and to all the people;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	2	The contents whereof were these: King Antiochus to Simon thehigh priest and prince of his nation, and to the people of theJews, greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	3	Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdomof our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that Imay restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathereda multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships ofwar;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	4	My meaning also being to go through the country, that I maybe avenged of them that have destroyed it, and made many citiesin the kingdom desolate:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	5	Now therefore I confirm unto thee all the oblations which thekings before me granted thee, and whatsoever gifts besides theygranted.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	6	I give thee leave also to coin money for thy country withthine own stamp.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	7	And as concerning Jerusalem and the sanctuary, let them befree; and all the armour that thou hast made, and fortressesthat thou hast built, and keepest in thine hands, let themremain unto thee.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	8	And if anything be, or shall be, owing to the king, let it beforgiven thee from this time forth for evermore.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	9	Furthermore, when we have obtained our kingdom, we willhonour thee, and thy nation, and thy temple, with great honour,so that your honour shall be known throughout the world.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	10	In the hundred threescore and fourteenth year went Antiochusinto the land of his fathers: at which time all the forces cametogether unto him, so that few were left with Tryphon.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	11	Wherefore being pursued by king Antiochus, he fled unto Dora,which lieth by the sea side:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	12	For he saw that troubles came upon him all at once, and thathis forces had forsaken him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	13	Then camped Antiochus against Dora, having with him anhundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousandhorsemen.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	14	And when he had compassed the city round about, and joinedships close to the town on the sea side, he vexed the city byland and by sea, neither suffered he any to go out or in.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	15	In the mean season came Numenius and his company from Rome,having letters to the kings and countries; wherein were writtenthese things:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	16	Lucius, consul of the Romans unto king Ptolemee, greeting:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	17	The Jews' ambassadors, our friends and confederates, cameunto us to renew the old friendship and league, being sent fromSimon the high priest, and from the people of the Jews:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	18	And they brought a shield of gold of a thousand pound.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	19	We thought it good therefore to write unto the kings andcountries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight againstthem, their cities, or countries, nor yet aid their enemiesagainst them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	20	It seemed also good to us to receive the shield of them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	21	If therefore there be any pestilent fellows, that have fledfrom their country unto you, deliver them unto Simon the highpriest, that he may punish them according to their own law.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	22	The same things wrote he likewise unto Demetrius the king,and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	23	And to all the countries and to Sampsames, and theLacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sicyon, and Caria,and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, andRhodus, and Aradus, and Cos, and Side, and Aradus, and Gortyna,and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	24	And the copy hereof they wrote to Simon the high priest.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	25	So Antiochus the king camped against Dora the second day,assaulting it continually, and making engines, by which means heshut up Tryphon, that he could neither go out nor in.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	26	At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aidhim; silver also, and gold, and much armour.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	27	Nevertheless he would not receive them, but brake all thecovenants which he had made with him afore, and became strangeunto him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	28	Furthermore he sent unto him Athenobius, one of his friends,to commune with him, and say, Ye withhold Joppa and Gazera; withthe tower that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my realm.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	29	The borders thereof ye have wasted, and done great hurt inthe land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdom.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	30	Now therefore deliver the cities which ye have taken, and thetributes of the places, whereof ye have gotten dominion withoutthe borders of Judea:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	31	Or else give me for them five hundred talents of silver; andfor the harm that ye have done, and the tributes of the cities,other five hundred talents: if not, we will come and fightagainst you
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	32	So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem: and whenhe saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold and silverplate, and his great attendance, he was astonished, and told himthe king's message.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	33	Then answered Simon, and said unto him, We have neither takenother men's land, nor holden that which appertaineth to others,but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies hadwrongfully in possession a certain time.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	34	Wherefore we, having opportunity, hold the inheritance of ourfathers.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	35	And whereas thou demandest Joppa and Gazera, albeit they didgreat harm unto the people in our country, yet will we give theean hundred talents for them. Hereunto Athenobius answered himnot a word;
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	36	But returned in a rage to the king, and made report unto himof these speeches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that hehad seen: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	37	In the mean time fled Tryphon by ship unto Orthosias.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	38	Then the king made Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, andgave him an host of footmen and horsemen,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	39	And commanded him to remove his host toward Judea; also hecommanded him to build up Cedron, and to fortify the gates, andto war against the people; but as for the king himself, hepursued Tryphon.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	40	So Cendebeus came to Jamnia and began to provoke the peopleand to invade Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and slaythem.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	15	41	And when he had built up Cedrou, he set horsemen there, andan host of footmen, to the end that issuing out they might makeoutroads upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	1	Then came up John from Gazera, and told Simon his father whatCendebeus had done.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	2	Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sons, Judas and John,and said unto them, I, and my brethren, and my father's house,have ever from my youth unto this day fought against the enemiesof Israel; and things have prospered so well in our hands, thatwe have delivered Israel oftentimes.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	3	But now I am old, and ye, by God's mercy, are of a sufficientage: be ye instead of me and my brother, and go and fight forour nation, and the help from heaven be with you.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	4	So he chose out of the country twenty thousand men of warwith horsemen, who went out against Cendebeus, and rested thatnight at Modin.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	5	And when as they rose in the morning, and went into theplain, behold, a mighty great host both of footmen and horsemencame against them: howbeit there was a water brook betwixt them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	6	So he and his people pitched over against them: and when hesaw that the people were afraid to go over the water brook, hewent first over himself, and then the men seeing him passedthrough after him.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	7	That done, he divided his men, and set the horsemen in themidst of the footmen: for the enemies' horsemen were very many.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	8	Then sounded they with the holy trumpets: whereupon Cendebeusand his host were put to flight, so that many of them wereslain, and the remnant gat them to the strong hold.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	9	At that time was Judas John's brother wounded; but John stillfollowed after them, until he came to Cedron, which Cendebeushad built.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	10	So they fled even unto the towers in the fields of Azotus;wherefore he burned it with fire: so that there were slain ofthem about two thousand men. Afterward he returned into the landof Judea in peace.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	11	Moreover in the plain of Jericho was Ptolemeus the son ofAbubus made captain, and he had abundance of silver and gold:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	12	For he was the high priest's son in law.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	13	Wherefore his heart being lifted up, he thought to get thecountry to himself, and thereupon consulted deceitfully againstSimon and his sons to destroy them.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	14	Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the country,and taking care for the good ordering of them; at which time hecame down himself to Jericho with his sons, Mattathias andJudas, in the hundred threescore and seventeenth year, in theeleventh month, called Sabat:
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	15	Where the son of Abubus receiving them deceitfully into alittle hold, called Docus, which he had built, made them a greatbanquet: howbeit he had hid men there.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	16	So when Simon and his sons had drunk largely, Ptolemee andhis men rose up, and took their weapons, and came upon Simoninto the banqueting place, and slew him, and his two sons, andcertain of his servants.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	17	In which doing he committed a great treachery, andrecompensed evil for good.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	18	Then Ptolemee wrote these things, and sent to the king, thathe should send him an host to aid him, and he would deliver himthe country and cities.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	19	He sent others also to Gazera to kill John: and unto thetribunes he sent letters to come unto him, that he might givethem silver, and gold, and rewards.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	20	And others he sent to take Jerusalem, and the mountain of thetemple.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	21	Now one had run afore to Gazera and told John that his fatherand brethren were slain, and, quoth he, Ptolemee hath sent toslay thee also.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	22	Hereof when he heard, he was sore astonished: so he laidhands on them that were come to destroy him, and slew them; forhe knew that they sought to make him away.
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	23	As concerning the rest of the acts of John, and his wars, andworthy deeds which he did, and the building of the walls whichhe made, and his doings,
The First Book of The Maccabees	1Mac	16	24	Behold, these are written in the chronicles of hispriesthood, from the time he was made high priest after hisfather.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	1	The brethren, the Jews that be at Jerusalem and in the landof Judea, wish unto the brethren, the Jews that are throughoutEgypt health and peace:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	2	God be gracious unto you, and remember his covenant that hemade with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, his faithful servants;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	3	And give you all an heart to serve him, and to do his will,with a good courage and a willing mind;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	4	And open your hearts in his law and commandments, and sendyou peace,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	5	And hear your prayers, and be at one with you, and neverforsake you in time of trouble.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	6	And now we be here praying for you.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	7	What time as Demetrius reigned, in the hundred threescore andninth year, we the Jews wrote unto you in the extremity oftrouble that came upon us in those years, from the time thatJason and his company revolted from the holy land and kingdom,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	8	And burned the porch, and shed innocent blood: then we prayedunto the Lord, and were heard; we offered also sacrifices andfine flour, and lighted the lamps, and set forth the loaves.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	9	And now see that ye keep the feast of tabernacles in themonth Casleu.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	10	In the hundred fourscore and eighth year, the people thatwere at Jerusalem and in Judea, and the council, and Judas, sentgreeting and health unto Aristobulus, king Ptolemeus' master,who was of the stock of the anointed priests, and to the Jewsthat were in Egypt:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	11	Insomuch as God hath delivered us from great perils, we thankhim highly, as having been in battle against a king.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	12	For he cast them out that fought within the holy city.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	13	For when the leader was come into Persia, and the army withhim that seemed invincible, they were slain in the temple ofNanea by the deceit of Nanea's priests.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	14	For Antiochus, as though he would marry her, came into theplace, and his friends that were with him, to receive money inname of a dowry.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	15	Which when the priests of Nanea had set forth, and he wasentered with a small company into the compass of the temple,they shut the temple as soon as Antiochus was come in:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	16	And opening a privy door of the roof, they threw stones likethunderbolts, and struck down the captain, hewed them in pieces,smote off their heads and cast them to those that were without.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	17	Blessed be our God in all things, who hath delivered up theungodly.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	18	Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep thepurification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day ofthe month Casleu, we thought it necessary to certify youthereof, that ye also might keep it, as the feast of thetabernacles, and of the fire, which was given us when Neemiasoffered sacrifice, after that he had builded the temple and thealtar.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	19	For when our fathers were led into Persia, the priests thatwere then devout took the fire of the altar privily, and hid itin an hollow place of a pit without water, where they kept itsure, so that the place was unknown to all men.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	20	Now after many years, when it pleased God, Neemias, beingsent from the king of Persia, did send of the posterity of thosepriests that had hid it to the fire: but when they told us theyfound no fire, but thick water;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	21	Then commanded he them to draw it up, and to bring it; andwhen the sacrifices were laid on, Neemias commanded the prieststo sprinkle the wood and the things laid thereupon with thewater.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	22	When this was done, and the time came that the sun shone,which afore was hid in the cloud, there was a great firekindled, so that every man marvelled.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	23	And the priests made a prayer whilst the sacrifice wasconsuming, I say, both the priests, and all the rest, Jonathanbeginning, and the rest answering thereunto, as Neemias did.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	24	And the prayer was after this manner; O Lord, Lord God,Creator of all things, who art fearful and strong, andrighteous, and merciful, and the only and gracious King,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	25	The only giver of all things, the only just, almighty, andeverlasting, thou that deliverest Israel from all trouble, anddidst choose the fathers, and sanctify them:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	26	Receive the sacrifice for thy whole people Israel, andpreserve thine own portion, and sanctify it.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	27	Gather those together that are scattered from us, deliverthem that serve among the heathen, look upon them that aredespised and abhorred, and let the heathen know that thou artour God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	28	Punish them that oppress us, and with pride do us wrong.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	29	Plant thy people again in thy holy place, as Moses hathspoken.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	30	And the priests sung psalms of thanksgiving.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	31	Now when the sacrifice was consumed, Neemias commanded thewater that was left to be poured on the great stones.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	32	When this was done, there was kindled a flame: but it wasconsumed by the light that shined from the altar.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	33	So when this matter was known, it was told the king ofPersia, that in the place, where the priests that were led awayhad hid the fire, there appeared water, and that Neemias hadpurified the sacrifices therewith.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	34	Then the king, inclosing the place, made it holy, after hehad tried the matter.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	35	And the king took many gifts, and bestowed thereof on thosewhom he would gratify.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	1	36	And Neemias called this thing Naphthar, which is as much asto say, a cleansing: but many men call it Nephi.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	1	It is also found in the records, that Jeremy the prophetcommanded them that were carried away to take of the fire, as ithath been signified:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	2	And how that the prophet, having given them the law, chargedthem not to forget the commandments of the Lord, and that theyshould not err in their minds, when they see images of silverand gold, with their ornaments.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	3	And with other such speeches exhorted he them, that the lawshould not depart from their hearts.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	4	It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet,being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to gowith him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Mosesclimbed up, and saw the heritage of God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	5	And when Jeremy came thither, he found an hollow cave,wherein he laid the tabernacle, and the ark, and the altar ofincense, and so stopped the door.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	6	And some of those that followed him came to mark the way, butthey could not find it.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	7	Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As forthat place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gatherhis people again together, and receive them unto mercy.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	8	Then shall the Lord shew them these things, and the glory ofthe Lord shall appear, and the cloud also, as it was shewedunder Moses, and as when Solomon desired that the place might behonourably sanctified.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	9	It was also declared, that he being wise offered thesacrifice of dedication, and of the finishing of the temple.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	10	And as when Moses prayed unto the Lord, the fire came downfrom heaven, and consumed the sacrifices: even so prayed Solomonalso, and the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burntofferings.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	11	And Moses said, Because the sin offering was not to be eaten,it was consumed.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	12	So Solomon kept those eight days.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	13	The same things also were reported in the writings andcommentaries of Neemias; and how he founding a library gatheredtogether the acts of the kings, and the prophets, and of David,and the epistles of the kings concerning the holy gifts.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	14	In like manner also Judas gathered together all those thingsthat were lost by reason of the war we had, and they remain withus,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	15	Wherefore if ye have need thereof, send some to fetch themunto you.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	16	Whereas we then are about to celebrate the purification, wehave written unto you, and ye shall do well, if ye keep the samedays.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	17	We hope also, that the God, that delivered all his people,and gave them all an heritage, and the kingdom, and thepriesthood, and the sanctuary,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	18	As he promised in the law, will shortly have mercy upon us,and gather us together out of every land under heaven into theholy place: for he hath delivered us out of great troubles, andhath purified the place.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	19	Now as concerning Judas Maccabeus, and his brethren, and thepurification of the great temple, and the dedication of thealtar,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	20	And the wars against Antiochus Epiphanes, and Eupator hisson,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	21	And the manifest signs that came from heaven unto those thatbehaved themselves manfully to their honour for Judaism: sothat, being but a few, they overcame the whole country, andchased barbarous multitudes,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	22	And recovered again the temple renowned all the world over,and freed the city, and upheld the laws which were going down,the Lord being gracious unto them with all favour:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	23	All these things, I say, being declared by Jason of Cyrene infive books, we will assay to abridge in one volume.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	24	For considering the infinite number, and the difficulty whichthey find that desire to look into the narrations of the story,for the variety of the matter,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	25	We have been careful, that they that will read may havedelight, and that they that are desirous to commit to memorymight have ease, and that all into whose hands it comes mighthave profit.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	26	Therefore to us, that have taken upon us this painful labourof abridging, it was not easy, but a matter of sweat andwatching;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	27	Even as it is no ease unto him that prepareth a banquet, andseeketh the benefit of others: yet for the pleasuring of many wewill undertake gladly this great pains;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	28	Leaving to the author the exact handling of every particular,and labouring to follow the rules of an abridgement.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	29	For as the master builder of a new house must care for thewhole building; but he that undertaketh to set it out, and paintit, must seek out fit things for the adorning thereof: even so Ithink it is with us.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	30	To stand upon every point, and go over things at large, andto be curious in particulars, belongeth to the first author ofthe story:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	31	But to use brevity, and avoid much labouring of the work, isto be granted to him that will make an abridgment.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	2	32	Here then will we begin the story: only adding thus much tothat which hath been said, that it is a foolish thing to make along prologue, and to be short in the story itself.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	1	Now when the holy city was inhabited with all peace, and thelaws were kept very well, because of the godliness of Onias thehigh priest, and his hatred of wickedness,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	2	It came to pass that even the kings themselves did honour theplace, and magnify the temple with their best gifts;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	3	Insomuch that Seleucus of Asia of his own revenues bare allthe costs belonging to the service of the sacrifices.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	4	But one Simon of the tribe of Benjamin, who was made governorof the temple, fell out with the high priest about disorder inthe city.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	5	And when he could not overcome Onias, he gat him toApollonius the son of Thraseas, who then was governor ofCelosyria and Phenice,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	6	And told him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full ofinfinite sums of money, so that the multitude of their riches,which did not pertain to the account of the sacrifices, wasinnumerable, and that it was possible to bring all into theking's hand.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	7	Now when Apollonius came to the king, and had shewed him ofthe money whereof he was told, the king chose out Heliodorus histreasurer, and sent him with a commandment to bring him theforesaid money.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	8	So forthwith Heliodorus took his journey; under a colour ofvisiting the cities of Celosyria and Phenice, but indeed tofulfil the king's purpose.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	9	And when he was come to Jerusalem, and had been courteouslyreceived of the high priest of the city, he told him whatintelligence was given of the money, and declared wherefore hecame, and asked if these things were so indeed.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	10	Then the high priest told him that there was such money laidup for the relief of widows and fatherless children:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	11	And that some of it belonged to Hircanus son of Tobias, a manof great dignity, and not as that wicked Simon had misinformed:the sum whereof in all was four hundred talents of silver, andtwo hundred of gold:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	12	And that it was altogether impossible that such wrongs shouldbe done unto them, that had committed it to the holiness of theplace, and to the majesty and inviolable sanctity of the temple,honoured over all the world.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	13	But Heliodorus, because of the king's commandment given him,said, That in any wise it must be brought into the king'streasury.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	14	So at the day which he appointed he entered in to order thismatter: wherefore there was no small agony throughout the wholecity.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	15	But the priests, prostrating themselves before the altar intheir priests' vestments, called unto heaven upon him that madea law concerning things given to he kept, that they shouldsafely be preserved for such as had committed them to be kept.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	16	Then whoso had looked the high priest in the face, it wouldhave wounded his heart: for his countenance and the changing ofhis colour declared the inward agony of his mind.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	17	For the man was so compassed with fear and horror of thebody, that it was manifest to them that looked upon him, whatsorrow he had now in his heart.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	18	Others ran flocking out of their houses to the generalsupplication, because the place was like to come into contempt.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	19	And the women, girt with sackcloth under their breasts,abounded in the streets, and the virgins that were kept in ran,some to the gates, and some to the walls, and others looked outof the windows.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	20	And all, holding their hands toward heaven, madesupplication.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	21	Then it would have pitied a man to see the falling down ofthe multitude of all sorts, and the fear of the high priestbeing in such an agony.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	22	They then called upon the Almighty Lord to keep the thingscommitted of trust safe and sure for those that had committedthem.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	23	Nevertheless Heliodorus executed that which was decreed.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	24	Now as he was there present himself with his guard about thetreasury, the Lord of spirits, and the Prince of all power,caused a great apparition, so that all that presumed to come inwith him were astonished at the power of God, and fainted, andwere sore afraid.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	25	For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible riderupon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ranfiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and itseemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete harness ofgold.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	26	Moreover two other young men appeared before him, notable instrength, excellent in beauty, and comely in apparel, who stoodby him on either side; and scourged him continually, and gavehim many sore stripes.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	27	And Heliodorus fell suddenly unto the ground, and wascompassed with great darkness: but they that were with himtook him up, and put him into a litter.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	28	Thus him, that lately came with a great train and with allhis guard into the said treasury, they carried out, being unableto help himself with his weapons: and manifestly theyacknowledged the power of God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	29	For he by the hand of God was cast down, and lay speechlesswithout all hope of life.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	30	But they praised the Lord, that had miraculously honoured hisown place: for the temple; which a little afore was full of fearand trouble, when the Almighty Lord appeared, was filled withjoy and gladness.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	31	Then straightways certain of Heliodorus' friends prayedOnias, that he would call upon the most High to grant him hislife, who lay ready to give up the ghost.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	32	So the high priest, suspecting lest the king shouldmisconceive that some treachery had been done to Heliodorus bythe Jews, offered a sacrifice for the health of the man.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	33	Now as the high priest was making an atonement, the sameyoung men in the same clothing appeared and stood besideHeliodorus, saying, Give Onias the high priest great thanks,insomuch as for his sake the Lord hath granted thee life:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	34	And seeing that thou hast been scourged from heaven, declareunto all men the mighty power of God. And when they had spokenthese words, they appeared no more.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	35	So Heliodorus, after he had offered sacrifice unto the Lord,and made great vows unto him that had saved his life, andsaluted Onias, returned with his host to the king.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	36	Then testified he to all men the works of the great God,which he had seen with his eyes.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	37	And when the king Heliodorus, who might be a fit man to besent yet once again to Jerusalem, he said,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	38	If thou hast any enemy or traitor, send him thither, and thoushalt receive him well scourged, if he escape with his life: forin that place, no doubt; there is an especial power of God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	39	For he that dwelleth in heaven hath his eye on that place,and defendeth it; and he beateth and destroyeth them that cometo hurt it.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	3	40	And the things concerning Heliodorus, and the keeping of thetreasury, fell out on this sort.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	1	This Simon now, of whom we spake afore, having been abetrayer of the money, and of his country, slandered Onias, asif he ha terrified Heliodorus, and been the worker of theseevils.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	2	Thus was he bold to call him a traitor, that had deservedwell of the city, and tendered his own nation, and was sozealous of the laws.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	3	But when their hatred went so far, that by one of Simon'sfaction murders were committed,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	4	Onias seeing the danger of this contention, and thatApollonius, as being the governor of Celosyria and Phenice, didrage, and increase Simon's malice,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	5	He went to the king, not to be an accuser of his countrymen,but seeking the good of all, both publick and private:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	6	For he saw that it was impossible that the state shouldcontinue quiet, and Simon leave his folly, unless the king didlook thereunto.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	7	But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, calledEpiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias labouredunderhand to be high priest,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	8	Promising unto the king by intercession three hundred andthreescore talents of silver, and of another revenue eightytalents:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	9	Beside this, he promised to assign an hundred and fifty more,if he might have licence to set him up a place for exercise, andfor the training up of youth in the fashions of the heathen, andto write them of Jerusalem by the name of Antiochians.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	10	Which when the king had granted, and he had gotten into hishand the rule he forthwith brought his own nation to Greekishfashion.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	11	And the royal privileges granted of special favour to theJews by the means of John the father of Eupolemus, who wentambassador to Rome for amity and aid, he took away; and puttingdown the governments which were according to the law, he broughtup new customs against the law:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	12	For he built gladly a place of exercise under the toweritself, and brought the chief young men under his subjection,and made them wear a hat.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	13	Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase ofheathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason,that ungodly wretch, and no high priest;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	14	That the priests had no courage to serve any more at thealtar, but despising the temple, and neglecting the sacrifices,hastened to be partakers of the unlawful allowance in the placeof exercise, after the game of Discus called them forth;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	15	Not setting by the honours of their fathers, but liking theglory of the Grecians best of all.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	16	By reason whereof sore calamity came upon them: for they hadthem to be their enemies and avengers, whose custom theyfollowed so earnestly, and unto whom they desired to be like inall things.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	17	For it is not a light thing to do wickedly against the lawsof God: but the time following shall declare these things.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	18	Now when the game that was used every faith year was kept atTyrus, the king being present,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	19	This ungracious Jason sent special messengers from Jerusalem,who were Antiochians, to carry three hundred drachms of silverto the sacrifice of Hercules, which even the bearers thereofthought fit not to bestow upon the sacrifice, because it was notconvenient, but to be reserved for other charges.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	20	This money then, in regard of the sender, was appointed toHercules' sacrifice; but because of the bearers thereof, it wasemployed to the making of gallies.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	21	Now when Apollonius the son of Menestheus was sent into Egyptfor the coronation of king Ptolemeus Philometor, Antiochus,understanding him not to be well affected to his affairs,provided for his own safety: whereupon he came to Joppa, andfrom thence to Jerusalem:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	22	Where he was honourably received of Jason, and of the city,and was brought in with torch alight, and with great shoutings:and so afterward went with his host unto Phenice.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	23	Three years afterward Jason sent Menelaus, the aforesaidSimon's brother, to bear the money unto the king, and to put himin mind of certain necessary matters.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	24	But he being brought to the presence of the king, when he hadmagnified him for the glorious appearance of his power, got thepriesthood to himself, offering more than Jason by three hundredtalents of silver.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	25	So he came with the king's mandate, bringing nothing worthythe high priesthood, but having the fury of a cruel tyrant, andthe rage of a savage beast.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	26	Then Jason, who had undermined his own brother, beingundermined by another, was compelled to flee into the country ofthe Ammonites.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	27	So Menelaus got the principality: but as for the money thathe had promised unto the king, he took no good order for it,albeit Sostratis the ruler of the castle required it:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	28	For unto him appertained the gathering of the customs.Wherefore they were both called before the king.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	29	Now Menelaus left his brother Lysimachus in his stead in thepriesthood; and Sostratus left Crates, who was governor of theCyprians.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	30	While those things were in doing, they of Tarsus and Mallosmade insurrection, because they were given to the king'sconcubine, called Antiochus.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	31	Then came the king in all haste to appease matters, leavingAndronicus, a man in authority, for his deputy.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	32	Now Menelaus, supposing that he had gotten a convenient time,stole certain vessels of gold out of the temple, and gave someof them to Andronicus, and some he sold into Tyrus and thecities round about.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	33	Which when Onias knew of a surety, he reproved him, andwithdrew himself into a sanctuary at Daphne, that lieth byAntiochia.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	34	Wherefore Menelaus, taking Andronicus apart, prayed, him toget Onias into his hands; who being persuaded thereunto, andcoming to Onias in deceit, gave him his right hand with oaths;and though he were suspected by him, yet persuaded he him tocome forth of the sanctuary: whom forthwith he shut up withoutregard of justice.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	35	For the which cause not only the Jews, but many also of othernations, took great indignation, and were much grieved for theunjust murder of the man.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	36	And when the king was come again from the places aboutCilicia, the Jews that were in the city, and certain of theGreeks that abhorred the fact also, complained because Onias wasslain without cause.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	37	Therefore Antiochus was heartily sorry, and moved to pity,and wept, because of the sober and modest behaviour of him thatwas dead.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	38	And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took awayAndronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading himthrough the whole city unto that very place, where he hadcommitted impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursedmurderer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he haddeserved.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	39	Now when many sacrileges had been committed in the city byLysimachus with the consent of Menelaus, and the fruit thereofwas spread abroad, the multitude gathered themselves togetheragainst Lysimachus, many vessels of gold being already carriedaway.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	40	Whereupon the common people rising, and being filled withrage, Lysimachus armed about three thousand men, and began firstto offer violence; one Auranus being the leader, a man far gonein years, and no less in folly.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	41	They then seeing the attempt of Lysimachus, some of themcaught stones, some clubs, others taking handfuls of dust, thatwas next at hand, cast them all together upon Lysimachus, andthose that set upon them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	42	Thus many of them they wounded, and some they struck to theground, and all of them they forced to flee: but as for thechurchrobber himself, him they killed beside the treasury.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	43	Of these matters therefore there was an accusation laidagainst Menelaus.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	44	Now when the king came to Tyrus, three men that were sentfrom the senate pleaded the cause before him:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	45	But Menelaus, being now convicted, promised Ptolemee the sonof Dorymenes to give him much money, if he would pacify the kingtoward him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	46	Whereupon Ptolemee taking the king aside into a certaingallery, as it were to take the air, brought him to be ofanother mind:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	47	Insomuch that he discharged Menelaus from the accusations,who notwithstanding was cause of all the mischief: and thosepoor men, who, if they had told their cause, yea, before theScythians, should have been judged innocent, them he condemnedto death.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	48	Thus they that followed the matter for the city, and for thepeople, and for the holy vessels, did soon suffer unjustpunishment.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	49	Wherefore even they of Tyrus, moved with hatred of thatwicked deed, caused them to be honourably buried.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	4	50	And so through the covetousness of them that were of powerMenelaus remained still in authority, increasing in malice, andbeing a great traitor to the citizens.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	1	About the same time Antiochus prepared his second voyage intoEgypt:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	2	And then it happened, that through all the city, for thespace almost of forty days, there were seen horsemen running inthe air, in cloth of gold, and armed with lances, like a band ofsoldiers,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	3	And troops of horsemen in array, encountering and running oneagainst another, with shaking of shields, and multitude ofpikes, and drawing of swords, and casting of darts, andglittering of golden ornaments, and harness of all sorts.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	4	Wherefore every man prayed that that apparition might turn togood.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	5	Now when there was gone forth a false rumour, as thoughAntiochus had been dead, Jason took at the least a thousand men,and suddenly made an assault upon the city; and they that wereupon the walls being put back, and the city at length taken,Menelaus fled into the castle:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	6	But Jason slew his own citizens without mercy, notconsidering that to get the day of them of his own nation wouldbe a most unhappy day for him; but thinking they had been hisenemies, and not his countrymen, whom he conquered.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	7	Howbeit for all this he obtained not the principality, but atthe last received shame for the reward of his treason, and fledagain into the country of the Ammonites.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	8	In the end therefore he had an unhappy return, being accusedbefore Aretas the king of the Arabians, fleeing from city tocity, pursued of all men, hated as a forsaker of the laws, andbeing had in abomination as an open enemy of his country andcountrymen, he was cast out into Egypt.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	9	Thus he that had driven many out of their country perished ina strange land, retiring to the Lacedemonians, and thinkingthere to find succour by reason of his kindred:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	10	And he that had cast out many unburied had none to mourn forhim, nor any solemn funerals at all, nor sepulchre with hisfathers.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	11	Now when this that was done came to the king's car, hethought that Judea had revolted: whereupon removing out of Egyptin a furious mind, he took the city by force of arms,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	12	And commanded his men of war not to spare such as they met,and to slay such as went up upon the houses.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	13	Thus there was killing of young and old, making away of men,women, and children, slaying of virgins and infants.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	14	And there were destroyed within the space of three whole daysfourscore thousand, whereof forty thousand were slain in theconflict; and no fewer sold than slain.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	15	Yet was he not content with this, but presumed to go intothe most holy temple of all the world; Menelaus, that traitor tothe laws, and to his own country, being his guide:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	16	And taking the holy vessels with polluted hands, and withprofane hands pulling down the things that were dedicated byother kings to the augmentation and glory and honour of theplace, he gave them away.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	17	And so haughty was Antiochus in mind, that he considered notthat the Lord was angry for a while for the sins of them thatdwelt in the city, and therefore his eye was not upon the place.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	18	For had they not been formerly wrapped in many sins, thisman, as soon as he had come, had forthwith been scourged, andput back from his presumption, as Heliodorus was, whom Seleucusthe king sent to view the treasury.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	19	Nevertheless God did not choose the people for the place'ssake, but the place far the people's sake.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	20	And therefore the place itself, that was partaker with themof the adversity that happened to the nation, did afterwardcommunicate in the benefits sent from the Lord: and as it wasforsaken in the wrath of the Almighty, so again, the great Lordbeing reconciled, it was set up with all glory.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	21	So when Antiochus had carried out of the temple a thousandand eight hundred talents, he departed in all haste untoAntiochia, weening in his pride to make the land navigable, andthe sea passable by foot: such was the haughtiness of his mind.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	22	And he left governors to vex the nation: at Jerusalem,Philip, for his country a Phrygian, and for manners morebarbarous than he that set him there;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	23	And at Garizim, Andronicus; and besides, Menelaus, who worsethan all the rest bare an heavy hand over the citizens, having amalicious mind against his countrymen the Jews.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	24	He sent also that detestable ringleader Apollonius with anarmy of two and twenty thousand, commanding him to slay allthose that were in their best age, and to sell the women and theyounger sort:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	25	Who coming to Jerusalem, and pretending peace, did forbeartill the holy day of the sabbath, when taking the Jews keepingholy day, he commanded his men to arm themselves.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	26	And so he slew all them that were gone to the celebrating ofthe sabbath, and running through the city with weapons slewgreat multitudes.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	5	27	But Judas Maccabeus with nine others, or thereabout, withdrewhimself into the wilderness, and lived in the mountains afterthe manner of beasts, with his company, who fed on herbscontinually, lest they should be partakers of the pollution.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	1	Not long after this the king sent an old man of Athens tocompel the Jews to depart from the laws of their fathers, andnot to live after the laws of God:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	2	And to pollute also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call itthe temple of Jupiter Olympius; and that in Garizim, of Jupiterthe Defender of strangers, as they did desire that dwelt in theplace.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	3	The coming in of this mischief was sore and grievous to thepeople:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	4	For the temple was filled with riot and revelling by theGentiles, who dallied with harlots, and had to do with womenwithin the circuit of the holy places, and besides that broughtin things that were not lawful.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	5	The altar also was filled with profane things, which the lawforbiddeth.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	6	Neither was it lawful for a man to keep sabbath days orancient fasts, or to profess himself at all to be a Jew.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	7	And in the day of the king's birth every month they werebrought by bitter constraint to eat of the sacrifices; and whenthe fast of Bacchus was kept, the Jews were compelled to go inprocession to Bacchus, carrying ivy.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	8	Moreover there went out a decree to the neighbour cities ofthe heathen, by the suggestion of Ptolemee, against the Jews,that they should observe the same fashions, and be partakers oftheir sacrifices:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	9	And whoso would not conform themselves to the manners of theGentiles should be put to death. Then might a man have seen thepresent misery.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	10	For there were two women brought, who had circumcised theirchildren; whom when they had openly led round about the city,the babes handing at their breasts, they cast them down headlongfrom the wall.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	11	And others, that had run together into caves near by, to keepthe sabbath day secretly, being discovered by Philip, were allburnt together, because they made a conscience to helpthemselves for the honour of the most sacred day.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	12	Now I beseech those that read this book, that they be notdiscouraged for these calamities, but that they judge thosepunishments not to be for destruction, but for a chastening ofour nation.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	13	For it is a token of his great goodness, when wicked doersare not suffered any long time, but forthwith punished.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	14	For not as with other nations, whom the Lord patientlyforbeareth to punish, till they be come to the fulness of theirsins, so dealeth he with us,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	15	Lest that, being come to the height of sin, afterwards heshould take vengeance of us.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	16	And therefore he never withdraweth his mercy from us: andthough he punish with adversity, yet doth he never forsake hispeople.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	17	But let this that we at spoken be for a warning unto us. Andnow will we come to the declaring of the matter in a few words.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	18	Eleazar, one of the principal scribes, an aged man, and of awell favoured countenance, was constrained to open his mouth,and to eat swine's flesh.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	19	But he, choosing rather to die gloriously, than to livestained with such an abomination, spit it forth, and came of hisown accord to the torment,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	20	As it behoved them to come, that are resolute to stand outagainst such things, as are not lawful for love of life to betasted.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	21	But they that had the charge of that wicked feast, for theold acquaintance they had with the man, taking him aside,besought him to bring flesh of his own provision, such as waslawful for him to use, and make as if he did eat of the fleshtaken from the sacrifice commanded by the king;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	22	That in so doing he might be delivered from death, and forthe old friendship with them find favour.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	23	But he began to consider discreetly, and as became his age,and the excellency of his ancient years, and the honour of hisgray head, whereon was come, and his most honest education froma child, or rather the holy law made and given by God: thereforehe answered accordingly, and willed them straightways to sendhim to the grave.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	24	For it becometh not our age, said he, in any wise todissemble, whereby many young persons might think that Eleazar,being fourscore years old and ten, were now gone to a strangereligion;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	25	And so they through mine hypocrisy, and desire to live alittle time and a moment longer, should be deceived by me, and Iget a stain to mine old age, and make it abominable.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	26	For though for the present time I should be delivered fromthe punishment of men: yet should I not escape the hand of theAlmighty, neither alive, nor dead.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	27	Wherefore now, manfully changing this life, I will shewmyself such an one as mine age requireth,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	28	And leave a notable example to such as be young to diewillingly and courageously for the honourable and holy laws. Andwhen he had said these words, immediately he went to thetorment:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	29	They that led him changing the good will they bare him alittle before into hatred, because the foresaid speechesproceeded, as they thought, from a desperate mind.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	30	But when he was ready to die with stripes, he groaned, andsaid, It is manifest unto the Lord, that hath the holyknowledge, that whereas I might have been delivered from death,I now endure sore pains in body by being beaten: but in soul amwell content to suffer these things, because I fear him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	6	31	And thus this man died, leaving his death for an example of anoble courage, and a memorial of virtue, not only unto youngmen, but unto all his nation.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	1	It came to pass also, that seven brethren with their motherwere taken, and compelled by the king against the law to tasteswine's flesh, and were tormented with scourges and whips.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	2	But one of them that spake first said thus, What wouldestthou ask or learn of us? we are ready to die, rather than totransgress the laws of our fathers.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	3	Then the king, being in a rage, commanded pans and caldronsto be made hot:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	4	Which forthwith being heated, he commanded to cut out thetongue of him that spake first, and to cut off the utmost partsof his body, the rest of his brethren and his mother looking on.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	5	Now when he was thus maimed in all his members, he commandedhim being yet alive to be brought to the fire, and to be friedin the pan: and as the vapour of the pan was for a good spacedispersed, they exhorted one another with the mother to diemanfully, saying thus,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	6	The Lord God looketh upon us, and in truth hath comfort inus, as Moses in his song, which witnessed to their faces,declared, saying, And he shall be comforted in his servants.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	7	So when the first was dead after this number, they broughtthe second to make him a mocking stock: and when they had pulledoff the skin of his head with the hair, they asked him, Wiltthou eat, before thou be punished throughout every member of thybody?
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	8	But he answered in his own language, and said, No. Whereforehe also received the next torment in order, as the former did.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	9	And when he was at the last gasp, he said, Thou like a furytakest us out of this present life, but the King of the worldshall raise us up, who have died for his laws, unto everlastinglife.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	10	After him was the third made a mocking stock: and when he wasrequired, he put out his tongue, and that right soon, holdingforth his hands manfully.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	11	And said courageously, These I had from heaven; and for hislaws I despise them; and from him I hope to receive them again.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	12	Insomuch that the king, and they that were with him,marvelled at the young man's courage, for that he nothingregarded the pains.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	13	Now when this man was dead also, they tormented and mangledthe fourth in like manner.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	14	So when he was ready to die he said thus, It is good, beingput to death by men, to look for hope from God to be raised upagain by him: as for thee, thou shalt have no resurrection tolife.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	15	Afterward they brought the fifth also, and mangled him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	16	Then looked he unto the king, and said, Thou hast power overmen, thou art corruptible, thou doest what thou wilt; yet thinknot that our nation is forsaken of God;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	17	But abide a while, and behold his great power, how he willtorment thee and thy seed.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	18	After him also they brought the sixth, who being ready to diesaid, Be not deceived without cause: for we suffer these thingsfor ourselves, having sinned against our God: thereforemarvellous things are done unto us.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	19	But think not thou, that takest in hand to strive againstGod, that thou shalt escape unpunished.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	20	But the mother was marvellous above all, and worthy ofhonourable memory: for when she saw her seven sons slain withinthe space of one day, she bare it with a good courage, becauseof the hope that she had in the Lord.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	21	Yea, she exhorted every one of them in her own language,filled with courageous spirits; and stirring up her womanishthoughts with a manly stomach, she said unto them,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	22	I cannot tell how ye came into my womb: for I neither gaveyou breath nor life, neither was it I that formed the members ofevery one of you;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	23	But doubtless the Creator of the world, who formed thegeneration of man, and found out the beginning of all things,will also of his own mercy give you breath and life again, as yenow regard not your own selves for his laws' sake.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	24	Now Antiochus, thinking himself despised, and suspecting itto be a reproachful speech, whilst the youngest was yet alive,did not only exhort him by words, but also assured him withoaths, that he would make him both a rich and a happy man, if hewould turn from the laws of his fathers; and that also he wouldtake him for his friend, and trust him with affairs.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	25	But when the young man would in no case hearken unto him, theking called his mother, and exhorted her that she would counselthe young man to save his life.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	26	And when he had exhorted her with many words, she promisedhim that she would counsel her son.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	27	But she bowing herself toward him, laughing the cruel tyrantto scorn, spake in her country language on this manner; O myson, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb,and gave thee such three years, and nourished thee, and broughtthee up unto this age, and endured the troubles of education.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	28	I beseech thee, my son, look upon the heaven and the earth,and all that is therein, and consider that God made them ofthings that were not; and so was mankind made likewise.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	29	Fear not this tormentor, but, being worthy of thy brethren,take thy death that I may receive thee again in mercy with thybrethren.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	30	Whiles she was yet speaking these words, the young man said,Whom wait ye for? I will not obey the king's commandment: but Iwill obey the commandment of the law that was given unto ourfathers by Moses.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	31	And thou, that hast been the author of all mischief againstthe Hebrews, shalt not escape the hands of God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	32	For we suffer because of our sins.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	33	And though the living Lord be angry with us a little whilefor our chastening and correction, yet shall he be at one againwith his servants.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	34	But thou, O godless man, and of all other most wicked, be notlifted up without a cause, nor puffed up with uncertain hopes,lifting up thy hand against the servants of God:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	35	For thou hast not yet escaped the judgment of Almighty God,who seeth all things.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	36	For our brethren, who now have suffered a short pain, aredead under God's covenant of everlasting life: but thou, throughthe judgment of God, shalt receive just punishment for thypride.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	37	But I, as my brethren, offer up my body and life for the lawsof our fathers, beseeching God that he would speedily bemerciful unto our nation; and that thou by torments and plaguesmayest confess, that he alone is God;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	38	And that in me and my brethren the wrath of the Almighty,which is justly brought upon our nation, may cease.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	39	Than the king' being in a rage, handed him worse than all therest, and took it grievously that he was mocked.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	40	So this man died undefiled, and put his whole trust in theLord.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	41	Last of all after the sons the mother died.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	7	42	Let this be enough now to have spoken concerning theidolatrous feasts, and the extreme tortures.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	1	Then Judas Maccabeus, and they that were with him, wentprivily into the towns, and called their kinsfolks together, andtook unto them all such as continued in the Jews' religion, andassembled about six thousand men.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	2	And they called upon the Lord, that he would look upon thepeople that was trodden down of all; and also pity the templeprofaned of ungodly men;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	3	And that he would have compassion upon the city, soredefaced, and ready to be made even with the ground; and hear theblood that cried unto him,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	4	And remember the wicked slaughter of harmless infants, andthe blasphemies committed against his name; and that he wouldshew his hatred against the wicked.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	5	Now when Maccabeus had his company about him, he could not bewithstood by the heathen: for the wrath of the Lord was turnedinto mercy.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	6	Therefore he came at unawares, and burnt up towns and cities,and got into his hands the most commodious places, and overcameand put to flight no small number of his enemies.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	7	But specially took he advantage of the night for such privyattempts, insomuch that the fruit of his holiness was spreadevery where.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	8	So when Philip saw that this man increased by little andlittle, and that things prospered with him still more and more,he wrote unto Ptolemeus, the governor of Celosyria and Phenice,to yield more aid to the king's affairs.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	9	Then forthwith choosing Nicanor the son of Patroclus, one ofhis special friends, he sent him with no fewer than twentythousand of all nations under him, to root out the wholegeneration of the Jews; and with him he joined also Gorgias acaptain, who in matters of war had great experience.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	10	So Nicanor undertook to make so much money of the captiveJews, as should defray the tribute of two thousand talents,which the king was to pay to the Romans.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	11	Wherefore immediately he sent to the cities upon the seacoast, proclaiming a sale of the captive Jews, and promisingthat they should have fourscore and ten bodies for one talent,not expecting the vengeance that was to follow upon him from theAlmighty God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	12	Now when word was brought unto Judas of Nicanor's coming, andhe had imparted unto those that were with him that the army wasat hand,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	13	They that were fearful, and distrusted the justice of God,fled, and conveyed themselves away.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	14	Others sold all that they had left, and withal besought theLord to deliver them, sold by the wicked Nicanor before they mettogether:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	15	And if not for their own sakes, yet for the covenants he hadmade with their fathers, and for his holy and glorious name'ssake, by which they were called.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	16	So Maccabeus called his men together unto the number of sixthousand, and exhorted them not to be stricken with terror ofthe enemy, nor to fear the great multitude of the heathen, whocame wrongly against them; but to fight manfully,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	17	And to set before their eyes the injury that they hadunjustly done to the holy place, and the cruel handling of thecity, whereof they made a mockery, and also the taking away ofthe government of their forefathers:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	18	For they, said he, trust in their weapons and boldness; butour confidence is in the Almighty who at a beck can cast downboth them that come against us, and also all the world.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	19	Moreover, he recounted unto them what helps their forefathershad found, and how they were delivered, when under Sennacheriban hundred fourscore and five thousand perished.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	20	And he told them of the battle that they had in Babylon withthe Galatians, how they came but eight thousand in all to thebusiness, with four thousand Macedonians, and that theMacedonians being perplexed, the eight thousand destroyed anhundred and twenty thousand because of the help that they hadfrom heaven, and so received a great booty.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	21	Thus when he had made them bold with these words, and readyto die for the law and the country, he divided his army intofour parts;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	22	And joined with himself his own brethren, leaders of eachband, to wit Simon, and Joseph, and Jonathan, giving each onefifteen hundred men.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	23	Also he appointed Eleazar to read the holy book: and when hehad given them this watchword, The help of God; himself leadingthe first band,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	24	And by the help of the Almighty they slew above nine thousandof their enemies, and wounded and maimed the most part ofNicanor's host, and so put all to flight;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	25	And took their money that came to buy them, and pursued themfar: but lacking time they returned:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	26	For it was the day before the sabbath, and therefore theywould no longer pursue them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	27	So when they had gathered their armour together, and spoiledtheir enemies, they occupied themselves about the sabbath,yielding exceeding praise and thanks to the Lord, who hadpreserved them unto that day, which was the beginning of mercydistilling upon them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	28	And after the sabbath, when they had given part of the spoilsto the maimed, and the widows, and orphans, the residue theydivided among themselves and their servants.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	29	When this was done, and they had made a common supplication,they besought the merciful Lord to be reconciled with hisservants for ever.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	30	Moreover of those that were with Timotheus and Bacchides, whofought against them, they slew above twenty thousand, and veryeasily got high and strong holds, and divided among themselvesmany spoils more, and made the maimed, orphans, widows, yea, andthe aged also, equal in spoils with themselves.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	31	And when they had gathered their armour together, they laidthem up all carefully in convenient places, and the remnant ofthe spoils they brought to Jerusalem.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	32	They slew also Philarches, that wicked person, who was withTimotheus, and had annoyed the Jews many ways.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	33	Furthermore at such time as they kept the feast for thevictory in their country they burnt Callisthenes, that had setfire upon the holy gates, who had fled into a little house; andso he received a reward meet for his wickedness.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	34	As for that most ungracious Nicanor, who had brought athousand merchants to buy the Jews,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	35	He was through the help of the Lord brought down by them, ofwhom he made least account; and putting off his gloriousapparel, and discharging his company, he came like a fugitiveservant through the midland unto Antioch having very greatdishonour, for that his host was destroyed.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	8	36	Thus he, that took upon him to make good to the Romans theirtribute by means of captives in Jerusalem, told abroad, that theJews had God to fight for them, and therefore they could not behurt, because they followed the laws that he gave them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	1	About that time came Antiochus with dishonour out of thecountry of Persia
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	2	For he had entered the city called Persepolis, and went aboutto rob the temple, and to hold the city; whereupon the multituderunning to defend themselves with their weapons put them toflight; and so it happened, that Antiochus being put to flightof the inhabitants returned with shame.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	3	Now when he came to Ecbatane, news was brought him what hadhappened unto Nicanor and Timotheus.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	4	Then swelling with anger. he thought to avenge upon the Jewsthe disgrace done unto him by those that made him flee.Therefore commanded he his chariotman to drive without ceasing,and to dispatch the journey, the judgment of GOd now followinghim. For he had spoken proudly in this sort, That he would cometo Jerusalem and make it a common burying place of the Jews.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac 9:5But	the Lor	 Almighty, the God of Isreal, smote him with an	incurable and invisible plague: or as soon as he had spokenthese words, a pain of the bowels that was remediless came uponhim, and sore torments of the inner parts;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	6	And that most justly: for he had tormented other men's bowelswith many and strange torments.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	7	Howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his bragging, but stillwas filled with pride, breathing out fire in his rage againstthe Jews, and commanding to haste the journey: but it came topass that he fell down from his chariot, carried violently; sothat having a sore fall, all the members of his body were muchpained.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	8	And thus he that a little afore thought he might command thewaves of the sea, (so proud was he beyond the condition of man)and weigh the high mountains in a balance, was now cast on theground, and carried in an horselitter, shewing forth unto allthe manifest power of God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	9	So that the worms rose up out of the body of this wicked man,and whiles he lived in sorrow and pain, his flesh fell away, andthe filthiness of his smell was noisome to all his army.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	10	And the man, that thought a little afore he could reach tothe stars of heaven, no man could endure to carry for hisintolerable stink.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	11	Here therefore, being plagued, he began to leave off hisgreat pride, and to come to the knowledge of himself by thescourge of God, his pain increasing every moment.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	12	And when he himself could not abide his own smell, he saidthese words, It is meet to be subject unto God, and that a manthat is mortal should not proudly think of himself if he wereGod.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	13	This wicked person vowed also unto the Lord, who now no morewould have mercy upon him, saying thus,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	14	That the holy city (to the which he was going in haste to layit even with the ground, and to make it a common buryingplace,)he would set at liberty:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	15	And as touching the Jews, whom he had judged not worthy somuch as to be buried, but to be cast out with their children tobe devoured of the fowls and wild beasts, he would make them allequals to the citizens of Athens:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	16	And the holy temple, which before he had spoiled, he wouldgarnish with goodly gifts, and restore all the holy vessels withmany more, and out of his own revenue defray the chargesbelonging to the sacrifices:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	17	Yea, and that also he would become a Jew himself, and gothrough all the world that was inhabited, and declare the powerof God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	18	But for all this his pains would not cease: for the justjudgment of God was come upon him: therefore despairing of hishealth, he wrote unto the Jews the letter underwritten,containing the form of a supplication, after this manner:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	19	Antiochus, king and governor, to the good Jews his citizenswisheth much joy, health, and prosperity:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	20	If ye and your children fare well, and your affairs be toyour contentment, I give very great thanks to God, having myhope in heaven.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	21	As for me, I was weak, or else I would have remembered kindlyyour honour and good will returning out of Persia, and beingtaken with a grievous disease, I thought it necessary to carefor the common safety of all:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	22	Not distrusting mine health, but having great hope to escapethis sickness.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	23	But considering that even my father, at what time he led anarmy into the high countries. appointed a successor,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	24	To the end that, if any thing fell out contrary toexpectation, or if any tidings were brought that were grievous,they of the land, knowing to whom the state was left, might notbe troubled:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	25	Again, considering how that the princes that are borderersand neighbours unto my kingdom wait for opportunities, andexpect what shall be the event. I have appointed my sonAntiochus king, whom I often committed and commended unto manyof you, when I went up into the high provinces; to whom I havewritten as followeth:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	26	Therefore I pray and request you to remember the benefitsthat I have done unto you generally, and in special, and thatevery man will be still faithful to me and my son.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	27	For I am persuaded that he understanding my mind willfavourably and graciously yield to your desires.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	28	Thus the murderer and blasphemer having suffered mostgrievously, as he entreated other men, so died he a miserabledeath in a strange country in the mountains.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	9	29	And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away hisbody, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt toPtolemeus Philometor.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	1	Now Maccabeus and his company, the Lord guiding them,recovered the temple and the city:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	2	But the altars which the heathen had built in the openstreet, and also the chapels, they pulled down.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	3	And having cleansed the temple they made another altar, andstriking stones they took fire out of them, and offered asacrifice after two years, and set forth incense, and lights,and shewbread.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	4	When that was done, they fell flat down, and besought theLord that they might come no more into such troubles; but ifthey sinned any more against him, that he himself would chastenthem with mercy, and that they might not be delivered unto theblasphemous and barbarous nations.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	5	Now upon the same day that the strangers profaned the temple,on the very same day it was cleansed again, even the five andtwentieth day of the same month, which is Casleu.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	6	And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feastof the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they hadheld the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in themountains and dens like beasts.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	7	Therefore they bare branches, and fair boughs, and palmsalso, and sang psalms unto him that had given them good successin cleansing his place.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	8	They ordained also by a common statute and decree, That everyyear those days should be kept of the whole nation of the Jews.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	9	And this was the end of Antiochus, called Epiphanes.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	10	Now will we declare the acts of Antiochus Eupator, who wasthe son of this wicked man, gathering briefly the calamities ofthe wars.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	11	So when he was come to the crown, he set one Lysias over theaffairs of his realm, and appointed him his chief governor ofCelosyria and Phenice.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	12	For Ptolemeus, that was called Macron, choosing rather to dojustice unto the Jews for the wrong that had been done untothem, endeavoured to continue peace with them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	13	Whereupon being accused of the king's friends before Eupator,and called traitor at every word because he had left Cyprus,that Philometor had committed unto him, and departed toAntiochus Epiphanes, and seeing that he was in no honourableplace, he was so discouraged, that he poisoned himself and died.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	14	But when Gorgias was governor of the holds, he hiredsoldiers, and nourished war continually with the Jews:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	15	And therewithall the Idumeans, having gotten into their handsthe most commodious holds, kept the Jews occupied, and receivingthose that were banished from Jerusalem, they went about tonourish war.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	16	Then they that were with Maccabeus made supplication, andbesought God that he would be their helper; and so they ran withviolence upon the strong holds of the Idumeans,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	17	And assaulting them strongly, they won the holds, and keptoff all that fought upon the wall, and slew all that fell intotheir hands, and killed no fewer than twenty thousand.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	18	And because certain, who were no less than nine thousand,were fled together into two very strong castles, having allmanner of things convenient to sustain the siege,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	19	Maccabeus left Simon and Joseph, and Zaccheus also, and themthat were with him, who were enough to besiege them, anddeparted himself unto those places which more needed his help.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	20	Now they that were with Simon, being led with covetousness,were persuaded for money through certain of those that were inthe castle, and took seventy thousand drachms, and let some ofthem escape.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	21	But when it was told Maccabeus what was done, he called thegovernors of the people together, and accused those men, thatthey had sold their brethren for money, and set their enemiesfree to fight against them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	22	So he slew those that were found traitors, and immediatelytook the two castles.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	23	And having good success with his weapons in all things hetook in hand, he slew in the two holds more than twentythousand.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	24	Now Timotheus, whom the Jews had overcome before, when he hadgathered a great multitude of foreign forces, and horses out ofAsia not a few, came as though he would take Jewry by force ofarms.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	25	But when he drew near, they that were with Maccabeus turnedthemselves to pray unto God, and sprinkled earth upon theirheads, and girded their loins with sackcloth,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	26	And fell down at the foot of the altar, and besought him tobe merciful to them, and to be an enemy to their enemies, and anadversary to their adversaries, as the law declareth.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	27	So after the prayer they took their weapons, and went onfurther from the city: and when they drew near to their enemies,they kept by themselves.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	28	Now the sun being newly risen, they joined both together; theone part having together with their virtue their refuge alsounto the Lord for a pledge of their success and victory: theother side making their rage leader of their battle
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	29	But when the battle waxed strong, there appeared unto theenemies from heaven five comely men upon horses, with bridles ofgold, and two of them led the Jews,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	30	And took Maccabeus betwixt them, and covered him on everyside weapons, and kept him safe, but shot arrows and lightningsagainst the enemies: so that being confounded with blindness,and full of trouble, they were killed.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	31	And there were slain of footmen twenty thousand and fivehundred, and six hundred horsemen.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	32	As for Timotheus himself, he fled into a very strong hold,called Gawra, where Chereas was governor.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	33	But they that were with Maccabeus laid siege against thefortress courageously four days.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	34	And they that were within, trusting to the strength of theplace, blasphemed exceedingly, and uttered wicked words.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	35	Nevertheless upon the fifth day early twenty young men ofMaccabeus' company, inflamed with anger because of theblasphemies, assaulted the wall manly, and with a fierce couragekilled all that they met withal.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	36	Others likewise ascending after them, whiles they were busiedwith them that were within, burnt the towers, and kindling firesburnt the blasphemers alive; and others broke open the gates,and, having received in the rest of the army, took the city,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	37	And killed Timotheus, that was hid in a certain pit, andChereas his brother, with Apollophanes.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	10	38	When this was done, they praised the Lord with psalms andthanksgiving, who had done so great things for Israel, and giventhem the victory.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	1	Not long after the, Lysias the king's protector and cousin,who also managed the affairs, took sore displeasure for thethings that were done.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	2	And when he had gathered about fourscore thousand with allthe horsemen, he came against the Jews, thinking to make thecity an habitation of the Gentiles,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	3	And to make a gain of the temple, as of the other chapels ofthe heathen, and to set the high priesthood to sale every year:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	4	Not at all considering the power of God but puffed up withhis ten thousands of footmen, and his thousands of horsemen, andhis fourscore elephants.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	5	So he came to Judea, and drew near to Bethsura, which was astrong town, but distant from Jerusalem about five furlongs, andhe laid sore siege unto it.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	6	Now when they that were with Maccabeus heard that he besiegedthe holds, they and all the people with lamentation and tearsbesought the Lord that he would send a good angel to deliverIsrael.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	7	Then Maccabeus himself first of all took weapons, exhortingthe other that they would jeopard themselves together with himto help their brethren: so they went forth together with awilling mind.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	8	And as they were at Jerusalem, there appeared before them onhorseback one in white clothing, shaking his armour of gold.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	9	Then they praised the merciful God all together, and tookheart, insomuch that they were ready not only to fight with men,but with most cruel beasts, and to pierce through walls of iron.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	10	Thus they marched forward in their armour, having an helperfrom heaven: for the Lord was merciful unto them
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	11	And giving a charge upon their enemies like lions, they sleweleven thousand footmen, and sixteen hundred horsemen, and putall the other to flight.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	12	Many of them also being wounded escaped naked; and Lysiashimself fled away shamefully, and so escaped.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	13	Who, as he was a man of understanding, casting with himselfwhat loss he had had, and considering that the Hebrews could notbe overcome, because the Almighty God helped them, he sent untothem,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	14	And persuaded them to agree to all reasonable conditions, andpromised that he would persuade the king that he must needs be afriend unto them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	15	Then Maccabeus consented to all that Lysias desired, beingcareful of the common good; and whatsoever Maccabeus wrote untoLysias concerning the Jews, the king granted it.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	16	For there were letters written unto the Jews from Lysias tothis effect: Lysias unto the people of the Jews sendethgreeting:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	17	John and Absolom, who were sent from you, delivered me thepetition subscribed, and made request for the performance of thecontents thereof.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	18	Therefore what things soever were meet to be reported to theking, I have declared them, and he hath granted as much as mightbe.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	19	And if then ye will keep yourselves loyal to the state,hereafter also will I endeavour to be a means of your good.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	20	But of the particulars I have given order both to these andthe other that came from me, to commune with you.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	21	Fare ye well. The hundred and eight and fortieth year, thefour and twentieth day of the month Dioscorinthius.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	22	Now the king's letter contained these words: King Antiochusunto his brother Lysias sendeth greeting:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	23	Since our father is translated unto the gods, our will is,that they that are in our realm live quietly, that every one mayattend upon his own affairs.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	24	We understand also that the Jews would not consent to ourfather, for to be brought unto the custom of the Gentiles, buthad rather keep their own manner of living: for the which causethey require of us, that we should suffer them to live aftertheir own laws.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	25	Wherefore our mind is, that this nation shall be in rest, andwe have determined to restore them their temple, that they maylive according to the customs of their forefathers.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	26	Thou shalt do well therefore to send unto them, and grantthem peace, that when they are certified of our mind, they maybe of good comfort, and ever go cheerfully about their ownaffairs.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	27	And the letter of the king unto the nation of the Jews wasafter this manner: King Antiochus sendeth greeting unto thecouncil, and the rest of the Jews:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	28	If ye fare well, we have our desire; we are also in goodhealth.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	29	Menelaus declared unto us, that your desire was to returnhome, and to follow your own business:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	30	Wherefore they that will depart shall have safe conduct tillthe thirtieth day of Xanthicus with security.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	31	And the Jews shall use their own kind of meats and laws, asbefore; and none of them any manner of ways shall be molestedfor things ignorantly done.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	32	I have sent also Menelaus, that he may comfort you.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	33	Fare ye well. In the hundred forty and eighth year, and thefifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	34	The Romans also sent unto them a letter containing thesewords: Quintus Memmius and Titus Manlius, ambassadors of theRomans, send greeting unto the people of the Jews.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	35	Whatsoever Lysias the king's cousin hath granted, therewithwe also are well pleased.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	36	But touching such things as he judged to be referred to theking, after ye have advised thereof, send one forthwith, that wemay declare as it is convenient for you: for we are now going toAntioch.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	37	Therefore send some with speed, that we may know what is yourmind.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	11	38	Farewell. This hundred and eight and fortieth year, thefifteenth day of the month Xanthicus.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	1	When these covenants were made, Lysias went unto the king,and the Jews were about their husbandry.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	2	But of the governours of several places, Timotheus, andApollonius the son of Genneus, also Hieronymus, and Demophon,and beside them Nicanor the governor of Cyprus, would not sufferthem to be quiet and live in peace.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	3	The men of Joppa also did such an ungodly deed: they prayedthe Jews that dwelt among them to go with their wives andchildren into the boats which they had prepared, as though theyhad meant them no hurt.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	4	Who accepted of it according to the common decree of thecity, as being desirous to live in peace, and suspectingnothing: but when they were gone forth into the deep, theydrowned no less than two hundred of them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	5	When Judas heard of this cruelty done unto his countrymen, hecommanded those that were with him to make them ready.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	6	And calling upon God the righteous Judge, he came againstthose murderers of his brethren, and burnt the haven by night,and set the boats on fire, and those that fled thither he slew.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	7	And when the town was shut up, he went backward, as if hewould return to root out all them of the city of Joppa.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	8	But when he heard that the Jamnites were minded to do in likemanner unto the Jews that dwelt among them,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	9	He came upon the Jamnites also by night, and set fire on thehaven and the navy, so that the light of the fire was seen atJerusalem two hundred and forty furlongs off.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	10	Now when they were gone from thence nine furlongs in theirjourney toward Timotheus, no fewer than five thousand men onfoot and five hundred horsemen of the Arabians set upon him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	11	Whereupon there was a very sore battle; but Judas' side bythe help of God got the victory; so that the Nomades of Arabia,being overcome, besought Judas for peace, promising both to givehim cattle, and to pleasure him otherwise.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	12	Then Judas, thinking indeed that they would be profitable inmany things, granted them peace: whereupon they shook hands, andso they departed to their tents.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	13	He went also about to make a bridge to a certain strong city,which was fenced about with walls, and inhabited by people ofdivers countries; and the name of it was Caspis.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	14	But they that were within it put such trust in the strengthof the walls and provision of victuals, that they behavedthemselves rudely toward them that were with Judas, railing andblaspheming, and uttering such words as were not to be spoken.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	15	Wherefore Judas with his company, calling upon the great Lordof the world, who without rams or engines of war did cast downJericho in the time of Joshua, gave a fierce assault against thewalls,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	16	And took the city by the will of God, and made unspeakableslaughters, insomuch that a lake two furlongs broad nearadjoining thereunto, being filled full, was seen running withblood.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	17	Then departed they from thence seven hundred and fiftyfurlongs, and came to Characa unto the Jews that are calledTubieni.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	18	But as for Timotheus, they found him not in the places: forbefore he had dispatched any thing, he departed from thence,having left a very strong garrison in a certain hold.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	19	Howbeit Dositheus and Sosipater, who were of Maccabeus'captains, went forth, and slew those that Timotheus had left inthe fortress, above ten thousand men.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	20	And Maccabeus ranged his army by bands, and set them over thebands, and went against Timotheus, who had about him an hundredand twenty thousand men of foot, and two thousand and fivehundred horsemen.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	21	Now when Timotheus had knowledge of Judas' coming, he sentthe women and children and the other baggage unto a fortresscalled Carnion: for the town was hard to besiege, and uneasy tocome unto, by reason of the straitness of all the places.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	22	But when Judas his first band came in sight, the enemies,being smitten with fear and terror through the appearing of himwho seeth all things, fled amain, one running into this way,another that way, so as that they were often hurt of their ownmen, and wounded with the points of their own swords.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	23	Judas also was very earnest in pursuing them, killing thosewicked wretches, of whom he slew about thirty thousand men.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	24	Moreover Timotheus himself fell into the hands of Dositheusand Sosipater, whom he besought with much craft to let him gowith his life, because he had many of the Jews' parents, and thebrethren of some of them, who, if they put him to death, shouldnot be regarded.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	25	So when he had assured them with many words that he wouldrestore them without hurt, according to the agreement, they lethim go for the saving of their brethren.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	26	Then Maccabeus marched forth to Carnion, and to the temple ofAtargatis, and there he slew five and twenty thousand persons.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	27	And after he had put to flight and destroyed them, Judasremoved the host toward Ephron, a strong city, wherein Lysiasabode, and a great multitude of divers nations, and the strongyoung men kept the walls, and defended them mightily: whereinalso was great provision of engines and darts.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	28	But when Judas and his company had called upon Almighty God,who with his power breaketh the strength of his enemies, theywon the city, and slew twenty and five thousand of them thatwere within,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	29	From thence they departed to Scythopolis, which lieth sixhundred furlongs from Jerusalem,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	30	But when the Jews that dwelt there had testified that theScythopolitans dealt lovingly with them, and entreated themkindly in the time of their adversity;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	31	They gave them thanks, desiring them to be friendly stillunto them: and so they came to Jerusalem, the feast of the weeksapproaching.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	32	And after the feast, called Pentecost, they went forthagainst Gorgias the governor of Idumea,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	33	Who came out with three thousand men of foot and four hundredhorsemen.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	34	And it happened that in their fighting together a few of theJews were slain.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	35	At which time Dositheus, one of Bacenor's company, who was onhorseback, and a strong man, was still upon Gorgias, and takinghold of his coat drew him by force; and when he would have takenthat cursed man alive, a horseman of Thracia coming upon himsmote off his shoulder, so that Gorgias fled unto Marisa.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	36	Now when they that were with Gorgias had fought long, andwere weary, Judas called upon the Lord, that he would shewhimself to be their helper and leader of the battle.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	37	And with that he began in his own language, and sung psalmswith a loud voice, and rushing unawares upon Gorgias' men, heput them to flight.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	38	So Judas gathered his host, and came into the city ofOdollam, And when the seventh day came, they purifiedthemselves, as the custom was, and kept the sabbath in the sameplace.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	39	And upon the day following, as the use had been, Judas andhis company came to take up the bodies of them that were slain,and to bury them with their kinsmen in their fathers' graves.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	40	Now under the coats of every one that was slain they foundthings consecrated to the idols of the Jamnites, which isforbidden the Jews by the law. Then every man saw that this wasthe cause wherefore they were slain.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	41	All men therefore praising the Lord, the righteous Judge, whohad opened the things that were hid,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	42	Betook themselves unto prayer, and besought him that the sincommitted might wholly be put out of remembrance. Besides, thatnoble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves from sin,forsomuch as they saw before their eyes the things that came topass for the sins of those that were slain.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	43	And when he had made a gathering throughout the company tothe sum of two thousand drachms of silver, he sent it toJerusalem to offer a sin offering, doing therein very well andhonestly, in that he was mindful of the resurrection:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	44	For if he had not hoped that they that were slain should haverisen again, it had been superfluous and vain to pray for thedead.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	12	45	And also in that he perceived that there was great favourlaid up for those that died godly, it was an holy and goodthought. Whereupon he made a reconciliation for the dead, thatthey might be delivered from sin.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	1	In the hundred forty and ninth year it was told Judas, thatAntiochus Eupator was coming with a great power into Judea,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	2	And with him Lysias his protector, and ruler of his affairs,having either of them a Grecian power of footmen, an hundred andten thousand, and horsemen five thousand and three hundred, andelephants two and twenty, and three hundred chariots armed withhooks.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	3	Menelaus also joined himself with them, and with greatdissimulation encouraged Antiochus, not for the safeguard of thecountry, but because he thought to have been made governor.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	4	But the King of kings moved Antiochus' mind against thiswicked wretch, and Lysias informed the king that this man wasthe cause of all mischief, so that the king commanded to bringhim unto Berea, and to put him to death, as the manner is inthat place.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	5	Now there was in that place a tower of fifty cubits high,full of ashes, and it had a round instrument which on every sidehanged down into the ashes.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	6	And whosoever was condemned of sacrilege, or had committedany other grievous crime, there did all men thrust him untodeath.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	7	Such a death it happened that wicked man to die, not havingso much as burial in the earth; and that most justly:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	8	For inasmuch as he had committed many sins about the altar,whose fire and ashes were holy, he received his death in ashes.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	9	Now the king came with a barbarous and haughty mind to do farworse to the Jews, than had been done in his father's time.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	10	Which things when Judas perceived, he commanded the multitudeto call upon the Lord night and day, that if ever at any othertime, he would now also help them, being at the point to be putfrom their law, from their country, and from the holy temple:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	11	And that he would not suffer the people, that had even nowbeen but a little refreshed, to be in subjection to theblasphemous nations.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	12	So when they had all done this together, and besought themerciful Lord with weeping and fasting, and lying flat upon theground three days long, Judas, having exhorted them, commandedthey should be in a readiness.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	13	And Judas, being apart with the elders, determined, beforethe king's host should enter into Judea, and get the city, to goforth and try the matter in fight by the help of the Lord.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	14	So when he had committed all to the Creator of the world, andexhorted his soldiers to fight manfully, even unto death, forthe laws, the temple, the city, the country, and thecommonwealth, he camped by Modin:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	15	And having given the watchword to them that were about him,Victory is of God; with the most valiant and choice young men hewent in into the king's tent by night, and slew in the campabout four thousand men, and the chiefest of the elephants, withall that were upon him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	16	And at last they filled the camp with fear and tumult, anddeparted with good success.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	17	This was done in the break of the day, because the protectionof the Lord did help him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	18	Now when the king had taken a taste of the manliness of theJews, he went about to take the holds by policy,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	19	And marched toward Bethsura, which was a strong hold of theJews: but he was put to flight, failed, and lost of his men:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	20	For Judas had conveyed unto them that were in it such thingsas were necessary.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	21	But Rhodocus, who was in the Jews' host, disclosed thesecrets to the enemies; therefore he was sought out, and whenthey had gotten him, they put him in prison.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	22	The king treated with them in Bethsum the second time, gavehis hand, took their's, departed, fought with Judas, wasovercome;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	23	Heard that Philip, who was left over the affairs in Antioch,was desperately bent, confounded, intreated the Jews, submittedhimself, and sware to all equal conditions, agreed with them,and offered sacrifice, honoured the temple, and dealt kindlywith the place,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	24	And accepted well of Maccabeus, made him principal governorfrom Ptolemais unto the Gerrhenians;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	25	Came to Ptolemais: the people there were grieved for thecovenants; for they stormed, because they would make theircovenants void:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	13	26	Lysias went up to the judgment seat, said as much as could bein defence of the cause, persuaded, pacified, made them wellaffected, returned to Antioch. Thus it went touching the king'scoming and departing.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	1	After three years was Judas informed, that Demetrius the sonof Seleucus, having entered by the haven of Tripolis with agreat power and navy,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	2	Had taken the country, and killed Antiochus, and Lysias hisprotector.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	3	Now one Alcimus, who had been high priest, and had defiledhimself wilfully in the times of their mingling with theGentiles, seeing that by no means he could save himself, norhave any more access to the holy altar,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	4	Came to king Demetrius in the hundred and one and fiftiethyear, presenting unto him a crown of gold, and a palm, and alsoof the boughs which were used solemnly in the temple: and sothat day he held his peace.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	5	Howbeit having gotten opportunity to further his foolishenterprize, and being called into counsel by Demetrius, andasked how the Jews stood affected, and what they intended, heanswered thereunto:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	6	Those of the Jews that he called Assideans, whose captain isJudas Maccabeus, nourish war and are seditious, and will not letthe rest be in peace.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	7	Therefore I, being deprived of mine ancestors' honour, I meanthe high priesthood, am now come hither:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	8	First, verily for the unfeigned care I have of thingspertaining to the king; and secondly, even for that I intend thegood of mine own countrymen: for all our nation is in no smallmisery through the unadvised dealing of them aforersaid.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	9	Wherefore, O king, seeing knowest all these things, becareful for the country, and our nation, which is pressed onevery side, according to the clemency that thou readily shewestunto all.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	10	For as long as Judas liveth, it is not possible that thestate should be quiet.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	11	This was no sooner spoken of him, but others of the king'sfriends, being maliciously set against Judas, did more incenseDemetrius.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	12	And forthwith calling Nicanor, who had been master of theelephants, and making him governor over Judea, he sent himforth,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	13	Commanding him to slay Judas, and to scatter them that werewith him, and to make Alcimus high priest of the great temple.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	14	Then the heathen, that had fled out of Judea from Judas, cameto Nicanor by flocks, thinking the harm and calamities ot theJews to be their welfare.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	15	Now when the Jews heard of Nicanor's coming, and that theheathen were up against them, they cast earth upon their heads,and made supplication to him that had established his people forever, and who always helpeth his portion with manifestation ofhis presence.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	16	So at the commandment of the captain they removedstraightways from thence, and came near unto them at the town ofDessau.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	17	Now Simon, Judas' brother, had joined battle with Nicanor,but was somewhat discomfited through the sudden silence of hisenemies.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	18	Nevertheless Nicanor, hearing of the manliness of them thatwere with Judas, and the courageousness that they had to fightfor their country, durst not try the matter by the sword.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	19	Wherefore he sent Posidonius, and Theodotus, and Mattathias,to make peace.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	20	So when they had taken long advisement thereupon, and thecaptain had made the multitude acquainted therewith, and itappeared that they were all of one mind, they consented to thecovenants,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	21	And appointed a day to meet in together by themselves: andwhen the day came, and stools were set for either of them,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	22	Ludas placed armed men ready in convenient places, lest sometreachery should be suddenly practised by the enemies: so theymade a peaceable conference.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	23	Now Nicanor abode in Jerusalem, and did no hurt, but sentaway the people that came flocking unto him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	24	And he would not willingly have Judas out of his sight: forhe love the man from his heart
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	25	He prayed him also to take a wife, and to beget children: sohe married, was quiet, and took part of this life.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	26	But Alcimus, perceiving the love that was betwixt them, andconsidering the covenants that were made, came to Demetrius, andtold him that Nicanor was not well affected toward the state;for that he had ordained Judas, a traitor to his realm, to bethe king's successor.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	27	Then the king being in a rage, and provoked with theaccusations of the most wicked man, wrote to Nicanor, signifyingthat he was much displeased with the covenants, and commandinghim that he should send Maccabeus prisoner in all haste untoAntioch.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	28	When this came to Nicanor's hearing, he was much confoundedin himself, and took it grievously that he should make void thearticles which were agreed upon, the man being in no fault.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	29	But because there was no dealing against the king, he watchedhis time to accomplish this thing by policy.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	30	Notwithstanding, when Maccabeus saw that Nicanor began to bechurlish unto him, and that he entreated him more roughly thanhe was wont, perceiving that such sour behaviour came not ofgood, he gathered together not a few of his men, and withdrewhimself from Nicanor.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	31	But the other, knowing that he was notably prevented byJudas' policy, came into the great and holy temple, andcommanded the priests, that were offering their usualsacrifices, to deliver him the man.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	32	And when they sware that they could not tell where the manwas whom he sought,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	33	He stretched out his right hand toward the temple, and madean oath in this manner: If ye will not deliver me Judas as aprisoner, I will lay this temple of God even with the ground,and I will break down the altar, and erect a notable temple untoBacchus.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	34	After these words he departed. Then the priests lifted uptheir hands toward heaven, and besought him that was ever adefender of their nation, saying in this manner;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	35	Thou, O Lord of all things, who hast need of nothing, wastpleased that the temple of thine habitation should be among us:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	36	Therefore now, O holy Lord of all holiness, keep this houseever undefiled, which lately was cleansed, and stop everyunrighteous mouth.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	37	Now was there accused unto Nicanor one Razis, one of theelders of Jerusalem, a lover of his countrymen, and a man ofvery good report, who for his kindness was called a father ofthe Jews.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	38	For in the former times, when they mingled not themselveswith the Gentiles, he had been accused of Judaism, and didboldly jeopard his body and life with all vehemency for thereligion of the Jews.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	39	So Nicanor, willing to declare the hate that he bare unto theJews, sent above five hundred men of war to take him:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	40	For he thought by taking him to do the Jews much hurt.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	41	Now when the multitude would have taken the tower, andviolently broken into the outer door, and bade that fire shouldbe brought to burn it, he being ready to be taken on every sidefell upon his sword;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	42	Choosing rather to die manfully, than to come into the handsof the wicked, to be abused otherwise than beseemed his noblebirth:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	43	But missing his stroke through haste, the multitude alsorushing within the doors, he ran boldly up to the wall, and casthimself down manfully among the thickest of them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	44	But they quickly giving back, and a space being made, he felldown into the midst of the void place.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	45	Nevertheless, while there was yet breath within him, beinginflamed with anger, he rose up; and though his blood gushed outlike spouts of water, and his wounds were grievous, yet he ranthrough the midst of the throng; and standing upon a steep rock,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	14	46	When as his blood was now quite gone, he plucked out hisbowels, and taking them in both his hands, he cast them upon thethrong, and calling upon the Lord of life and spirit to restorehim those again, he thus died.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	1	But Nicanor, hearing that Judas and his company were in thestrong places about Samaria, resolved without any danger to setupon them on the sabbath day.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	2	Nevertheless the Jews that were compelled to go with himsaid, O destroy not so cruelly and barbarously, but give honourto that day, which he, that seeth all things, hath honoured withholiness above all other days.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	3	Then the most ungracious wretch demanded, if there were aMighty one in heaven, that had commanded the sabbath day to bekept.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	4	And when they said, There is in heaven a living Lord, andmighty, who commanded the seventh day to be kept:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	5	Then said the other, And I also am mighty upon earth, and Icommand to take arms, and to do the king's business. Yet heobtained not to have his wicked will done.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	6	So Nicanor in exceeding pride and haughtiness determined toset up a publick monument of his victory over Judas and themthat were with him.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	7	But Maccabeus had ever sure confidence that the Lord wouldhelp him:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	8	Wherefore he exhorted his people not to fear the coming ofthe heathen against them, but to remember the help which informer times they had received from heaven, and now to expectthe victory and aid, which should come unto them from theAlmighty.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	9	And so comforting them out of the law and the prophets, andwithal putting them in mind of the battles that they won afore,he made them more cheerful.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	10	And when he had stirred up their minds, he gave them theircharge, shewing them therewithall the falsehood of the heathen,and the breach of oaths.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	11	Thus he armed every one of them, not so much with defence ofshields and spears, as with comfortable and good words: andbeside that, he told them a dream worthy to be believed, as ifit had been so indeed, which did not a little rejoice them.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	12	And this was his vision: That Onias, who had been highpriest, a virtuous and a good man, reverend in conversation,gentle in condition, well spoken also, and exercised from achild in all points of virtue, holding up his hands prayed forthe whole body of the Jews.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	13	This done, in like manner there appeared a man with grayhairs, and exceeding glorious, who was of a wonderful andexcellent majesty.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	14	Then Onias answered, saying, This is a lover of the brethren,who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy city, to wit,Jeremias the prophet of God.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	15	Whereupon Jeremias holding forth his right hand gave to Judasa sword of gold, and in giving it spake thus,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	16	Take this holy sword, a gift from God, with the which thoushalt wound the adversaries.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	17	Thus being well comforted by the words of Judas, which werevery good, and able to stir them up to valour, and to encouragethe hearts of the young men, they determined not to pitch camp,but courageously to set upon them, and manfully to try thematter by conflict, because the city and the sanctuary and thetemple were in danger.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	18	For the care that they took for their wives, and theirchildren, their brethren, and folks, was in least account withthem: but the greatest and principal fear was for the holytemple.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	19	Also they that were in the city took not the least care,being troubled for the conflict abroad.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	20	And now, when as all looked what should be the trial, and theenemies were already come near, and the army was set in array,and the beasts conveniently placed, and the horsemen set inwings,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	21	Maccabeus seeing the coming of the multitude, and the diverspreparations of armour, and the fierceness of the beasts,stretched out his hands toward heaven, and called upon the Lordthat worketh wonders, knowing that victory cometh not by arms,but even as it seemeth good to him, he giveth it to such as areworthy:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	22	Therefore in his prayer he said after this manner; O Lord,thou didst send thine angel in the time of Ezekias king ofJudea, and didst slay in the host of Sennacherib an hundredfourscore and five thousand:
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	23	Wherefore now also, O Lord of heaven, send a good angelbefore us for a fear and dread unto them;
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	24	And through the might of thine arm let those be stricken withterror, that come against thy holy people to blaspheme. And heended thus.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	25	Then Nicanor and they that were with him came forward withtrumpets and songs.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	26	But Judas and his company encountered the enemies withinvocation and prayer.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	27	So that fighting with their hands, and praying unto Godwith their hearts, they slew no less than thirtyand five thousand men: for through the appearance of God theywere greatly cheered.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	28	Now when the battle was done, returning again with joy, theyknew that Nicanor lay dead in his harness.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	29	Then they made a great shout and a noise, praising theAlmighty in their own language.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	30	And Judas, who was ever the chief defender of the citizensboth in body and mind, and who continued his love toward hiscountrymen all his life, commanded to strike off Nicanor's head,and his hand with his shoulder, and bring them to Jerusalem.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	31	So when he was there, and called them of his nation together,and set the priests before the altar, he sent for them that wereof the tower,
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	32	And shewed them vile Nicanor's head, and the hand of thatblasphemer, which with proud brags he had stretched out againstthe holy temple of the Almighty.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	33	And when he had cut out the tongue of that ungodly Nicanor,he commanded that they should give it by pieces unto the fowls,and hang up the reward of his madness before the temple.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	34	So every man praised toward the heaven the glorious Lord,saying, Blessed be he that hath kept his own place undefiled.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	35	He hanged also Nicanor's head upon the tower, an evident andmanifest sign unto all of the help of the Lord.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	36	And they ordained all with a common decree in no case to letthat day pass without solemnity, but to celebrate the thirtiethday of the twelfth month, which in the Syrian tongue is calledAdar, the day before Mardocheus' day.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	37	Thus went it with Nicanor: and from that time forth theHebrews had the city in their power. And here will I make anend.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	38	And if I have done well, and as is fitting the story, it isthat which I desired: but if slenderly and meanly, it is thatwhich I could attain unto.
The Second Book of the Maccabees	2Mac	15	39	For as it is hurtful to drink wine or water alone; and aswine mingled with water is pleasant, and delighteth the taste:even so speech finely framed delighteth the ears of them thatread the story. And here shall be an end.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	1	The book of the words of Tobit, son of Tobiel, the son ofAnaniel, the son of Aduel, the son of Gabael, of the seed ofAsael, of the tribe of Nephthali;
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	2	Who in the time of Enemessar king of the Assyrians was ledcaptive out of Thisbe, which is at the right hand of that city,which is called properly Nephthali in Galilee above Aser.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	3	I Tobit have walked all the days of my life in the ways oftruth and justice, and I did many almsdeeds to my brethren, andmy nation, who came with me to Nineve, into the land of theAssyrians.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	4	And when I was in mine own country, in the land of Israelbeing but young, all the tribe of Nephthali my father fell fromthe house of Jerusalem, which was chosen out of all the tribesof Israel, that all the tribes should sacrifice there, where thetemple of the habitation of the most High was consecrated andbuilt for all ages.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	5	Now all the tribes which together revolted, and the house ofmy father Nephthali, sacrificed unto the heifer Baal.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	6	But I alone went often to Jerusalem at the feasts, as it wasordained unto all the people of Israel by an everlasting decree,having the firstfruits and tenths of increase, with that whichwas first shorn; and them gave I at the altar to the priests thechildren of Aaron.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	7	The first tenth part of all increase I gave to the sons ofAaron, who ministered at Jerusalem: another tenth part I soldaway, and went, and spent it every year at Jerusalem:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	8	And the third I gave unto them to whom it was meet, as Deboramy father's mother had commanded me, because I was left anorphan by my father.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	9	Furthermore, when I was come to the age of a man, I marriedAnna of mine own kindred, and of her I begat Tobias.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	10	And when we were carried away captives to Nineve, all mybrethren and those that were of my kindred did eat of the breadof the Gentiles.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	11	But I kept myself from eating;
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	12	Because I remembered God with all my heart.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	13	And the most High gave me grace and favour before Enemessar,so that I was his purveyor.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	14	And I went into Media, and left in trust with Gabael, thebrother of Gabrias, at Rages a city of Media ten talents ofsilver.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	15	Now when Enemessar was dead, Sennacherib his son reigned inhis stead; whose estate was troubled, that I could not go intoMedia.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	16	And in the time of Enemessar I gave many alms to my brethren,and gave my bread to the hungry,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	17	And my clothes to the naked: and if I saw any of my nationdead, or cast about the walls of Nineve, I buried him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	18	And if the king Sennacherib had slain any, when he was come,and fled from Judea, I buried them privily; for in his wrath hekilled many; but the bodies were not found, when they weresought for of the king.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	19	And when one of the Ninevites went and complained of me tothe king, that I buried them, and hid myself; understanding thatI was sought for to be put to death, I withdrew myself for fear.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	20	Then all my goods were forcibly taken away, neither was thereany thing left me, beside my wife Anna and my son Tobias.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	21	And there passed not five and fifty days, before two of hissons killed him, and they fled into the mountains of Ararath;and Sarchedonus his son reigned in his stead; who appointed overhis father's accounts, and over all his affairs, Achiacharus mybrother Anael's son.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	1	22	And Achiacharus intreating for me, I returned to Nineve. NowAchiacharus was cupbearer, and keeper of the signet, andsteward, and overseer of the accounts: and Sarchedonus appointedhim next unto him: and he was my brother's son.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	1	Now when I was come home again, and my wife Anna was restoredunto me, with my son Tobias, in the feast of Pentecost, which isthe holy feast of the seven weeks, there was a good dinnerprepared me, in the which I sat down to eat.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	2	And when I saw abundance of meat, I said to my son, Go andbring what poor man soever thou shalt find out of our brethren,who is mindful of the Lord; and, lo, I tarry for thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	3	But he came again, and said, Father, one of our nation isstrangled, and is cast out in the marketplace.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	4	Then before I had tasted of any meat, I started up, and tookhim up into a room until the going down of the sun.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	5	Then I returned, and washed myself, and ate my meat inheaviness,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	6	Remembering that prophecy of Amos, as he said, Your feastsshall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth intolamentation.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	7	Therefore I wept: and after the going down of the sun I wentand made a grave, and buried him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	8	But my neighbours mocked me, and said, This man is not yetafraid to be put to death for this matter: who fled away; andyet, lo, he burieth the dead again.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	9	The same night also I returned from the burial, and slept bythe wall of my courtyard, being polluted and my face wasuncovered:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	10	And I knew not that there were sparrows in the wall, and mineeyes being open, the sparrows muted warm dung into mine eyes,and a whiteness came in mine eyes: and I went to the physicians,but they helped me not: moreover Achiacharus did nourish me,until I went into Elymais.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	11	And my wife Anna did take women's works to do.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	12	And when she had sent them home to the owners, they paid herwages, and gave her also besides a kid.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	13	And when it was in my house, and began to cry, I said untoher, From whence is this kid? is it not stolen? render it to theowners; for it is not lawful to eat any thing that is stolen.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	2	14	But she replied upon me, It was given for a gift more thanthe wages. Howbeit I did not believe her, but bade her render itto the owners: and I was abashed at her. But she replied uponme, Where are thine alms and thy righteous deeds? behold, thouand all thy works are known.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	1	Then I being grieved did weep, and in my sorrow prayed,saying,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	2	O Lord, thou art just, and all thy works and all thy ways aremercy and truth, and thou judgest truly and justly for ever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	3	Remember me, and look on me, punish me not for my sins andignorances, and the sins of mg fathers, who have sinned beforethee:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	4	For they obeyed not thy commandments: wherefore thou hastdelivered us for a spoil, and unto captivity, and unto death,and for a proverb of reproach to all the nations among whom weare dispersed.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	5	And now thy judgments are many and true: deal with meaccording to my sins and my fathers': because we have not keptthy commandments, neither have walked in truth before thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	6	Now therefore deal with me as seemeth best unto thee, andcommand my spirit to be taken from me, that I may be dissolved,and become earth: for it is profitable for me to die rather thanto live, because I have heard false reproaches, and have muchsorrow: command therefore that I may now be delivered out ofthis distress, and go into the everlasting place: turn not thyface away from me.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	7	It came to pass the same day, that in Ecbatane a city ofMedia Sara the daughter of Raguel was also reproached by herfather's maids;
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	8	Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whomAsmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain withher. Dost thou not know, said they, that thou hast strangledthine husbands? thou hast had already seven husbands, neitherwast thou named after any of them.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	9	Wherefore dost thou beat us for them? if they be dead, go thyways after them, let us never see of thee either son ordaughter.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	10	Whe she heard these things, she was very sorrowful, so thatshe thought to have strangled herself; and she said, I am theonly daughter of my father, and if I do this, it shall be areproach unto him, and I shall bring his old age with sorrowunto the grave.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	11	Then she prayed toward the window, and said, Blessed artthou, O Lord my God, and thine holy and glorious name is blessedand honourable for ever: let all thy works praise thee forever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	12	And now, O Lord, I set I mine eyes and my face toward thee,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	13	And say, Take me out of the earth, that I may hear no morethe reproach.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	14	Thou knowest, Lord, that I am pure from all sin with man,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	15	And that I never polluted my name, nor the name of my father,in the land of my captivity: I am the only daughter of myfather, neither hath he any child to be his heir, neither anynear kinsman, nor any son of his alive, to whom I may keepmyself for a wife: my seven husbands are already dead; and whyshould I live? but if it please not thee that I should die,command some regard to be had of me, and pity taken of me, thatI hear no more reproach.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	16	So the prayers of them both were heard before the majesty ofthe great God.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	3	17	And Raphael was sent to heal them both, that is, to scaleaway the whiteness of Tobit's eyes, and to give Sara thedaughter of Raguel for a wife to Tobias the son of Tobit; and tobind Asmodeus the evil spirit; because she belonged to Tobias byright of inheritance. The selfsame time came Tobit home, andentered into his house, and Sara the daughter of Raguel camedown from her upper chamber.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	1	In that day Tobit remembered the money which he had committedto Gabael in Rages of Media,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	2	And said with himself, I have wished for death; wherefore doI not call for my son Tobias that I may signify to him of themoney before I die?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	3	And when he had called him, he said, My son, when I am dead,bury me; and despise not thy mother, but honour her all the daysof thy life, and do that which shall please her, and grieve hernot.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	4	Remember, my son, that she saw many dangers for thee, whenthou wast in her womb: and when she is dead, bury her by me inone grave.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	5	My son, be mindful of the Lord our God all thy days, and letnot thy will be set to sin, or to transgress his commandments:do uprightly all thy life long, and follow not the ways ofunrighteousness.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	6	For if thou deal truly, thy doings shall prosperously succeedto thee, and to all them that live justly.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	7	Give alms of thy substance; and when thou givest alms, letnot thine eye be envious, neither turn thy face from any poor,and the face of God shall not be turned away from thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	8	If thou hast abundance give alms accordingly: if thou havebut a little, be not afraid to give according to that little:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	9	For thou layest up a good treasure for thyself against theday of necessity.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	10	Because that alms do deliver from death, and suffereth not tocome into darkness.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	11	For alms is a good gift unto all that give it in the sight ofthe most High.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	12	Beware of all whoredom, my son, and chiefly take a wife ofthe seed of thy fathers, and take not a strange woman to wife,which is not of thy father's tribe: for we are the children ofthe prophets, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: remember, my son,that our fathers from the beginning, even that they all marriedwives of their own kindred, and were blessed in their children,and their seed shall inherit the land.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	13	Now therefore, my son, love thy brethren, and despise not inthy heart thy brethren, the sons and daughters of thy people, innot taking a wife of them: for in pride is destruction and muchtrouble, and in lewdness is decay and great want: for lewdnessis the mother of famine.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	14	Let not the wages of any man, which hath wrought for thee,tarry with thee, but give him it out of hand: for if thou serveGod, he will also repay thee: be circumspect my son, in allthings thou doest, and be wise in all thy conversation.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	15	Do that to no man which thou hatest: drink not wine to makethee drunken: neither let drunkenness go with thee in thyjourney.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	16	Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to themthat are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: andlet not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	17	Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but givenothing to the wicked.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	18	Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counselthat is profitable.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	19	Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy waysmay be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels mayprosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himselfgiveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as hewill; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neitherlet them be put out of thy mind.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	20	And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talentsto Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	4	21	And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hastmuch wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and dothat which is pleasing in his sight.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	1	Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all thingswhich thou hast commanded me:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	2	But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	3	Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seekthee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I willgive him wages: and go and receive the money.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	4	Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael thatwas an angel.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	5	But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with meto Rages? and knowest thou those places well?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	6	To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know theway well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	7	Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell myfather.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	8	Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in andsaid to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go withme. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of whattribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	9	So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted oneanother.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	10	Then Tobit said unto him, Brother, shew me of what tribe andfamily thou art.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	11	To whom he said, Dost thou seek for a tribe or family, or anhired man to go with thy son? Then Tobit said unto him, I wouldknow, brother, thy kindred and name.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	12	Then he said, I am Azarias, the son of Ananias the great, andof thy brethren.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	13	Then Tobit said, Thou art welcome, brother; be not now angrywith me, because I have enquired to know thy tribe and thyfamily; for thou art my brother, of an honest and good stock:for I know Ananias and Jonathas, sons of that great Samaias, aswe went together to Jerusalem to worship, and offered thefirstborn, and the tenths of the fruits; and they were notseduced with the error of our brethren: my brother, thou art ofa good stock.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	14	But tell me, what wages shall I give thee? wilt thou a drachma day, and things necessary, as to mine own son?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	15	Yea, moreover, if ye return safe, I will add something to thywages.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	16	So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Preparethyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. Andwhen his son had prepared all things far the journey, his fathersaid, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven,prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. Sothey went forth both, and the young man's dog with them.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	17	But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thousent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going inand out before us?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	18	Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refusein respect of our child.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	19	For that which the Lord hath given us to live with dothsuffice us.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	20	Then said Tobit to her, Take no care, my sister; he shallreturn in safety, and thine eyes shall see him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	21	For the good angel will keep him company, and his journeyshall be prosperous, and he shall return safe.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	5	22	Then she made an end of weeping.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	1	And as they went on their journey, they came in the eveningto the river Tigris, and they lodged there.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	2	And when the young man went down to wash himself, a fishleaped out of the river, and would have devoured him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	3	Then the angel said unto him, Take the fish. And the youngman laid hold of the fish, and drew it to land.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	4	To whom the angel said, Open the fish, and take the heart andthe liver and the gall, and put them up safely.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	5	So the young man did as the angel commanded him; and whenthey had roasted the fish, they did eat it: then they both wenton their way, till they drew near to Ecbatane.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	6	Then the young man said to the angel, Brother Azarias, towhat use is the heart and the liver and the gal of the fish?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	7	And he said unto him, Touching the heart and the liver, if adevil or an evil spirit trouble any, we must make a smokethereof before the man or the woman, and the party shall be nomore vexed.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	8	As for the gall, it is good to anoint a man that hathwhiteness in his eyes, and he shall be healed.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	9	And when they were come near to Rages,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	10	The angel said to the young man, Brother, to day we shalllodge with Raguel, who is thy cousin; he also hath one onlydaughter, named Sara; I will speak for her, that she may begiven thee for a wife.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	11	For to thee doth the right of her appertain, seeing thou onlyart of her kindred.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	12	And the maid is fair and wise: now therefore hear me, and Iwill speak to her father; and when we return from Rages we willcelebrate the marriage: for I know that Raguel cannot marry herto another according to the law of Moses, but he shall be guiltyof death, because the right of inheritance doth rather appertainto thee than to any other.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	13	Then the young man answered the angel, I have heard, brotherAzarias that this maid hath been given to seven men, who alldied in the marriage chamber.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	14	And now I am the only son of my father, and I am afraid, lestif I go in unto her, I die, as the other before: for a wickedspirit loveth her, which hurteth no body, but those which comeunto her; wherefore I also fear lest I die, and bring myfather's and my mother's life because of me to the grave withsorrow: for they have no other son to bury them.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	15	Then the angel said unto him, Dost thou not remember theprecepts which thy father gave thee, that thou shouldest marry awife of thine own kindred? wherefore hear me, O my brother; forshe shall be given thee to wife; and make thou no reckoning ofthe evil spirit; for this same night shall she be given thee inmarriage.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	16	And when thou shalt come into the marriage chamber, thoushalt take the ashes of perfume, and shalt lay upon them some ofthe heart and liver of the fish, and shalt make a smoke with it:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	6	17	And the devil shall smell it, and flee away, and never comeagain any more: but when thou shalt come to her, rise up both ofyou, and pray to God which is merciful, who will have pity onyou, and save you: fear not, for she is appointed unto thee fromthe beginning; and thou shalt preserve her, and she shall gowith thee. Moreover I suppose that she shall bear thee children.Now when Tobias had heard these things, he loved her, and hisheart was effectually joined to her.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	1	And when they were come to Ecbatane, they came to the houseof Raguel, and Sara met them: and after they had saluted oneanother, she brought them into the house.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	2	Then said Raguel to Edna his wife, How like is this young manto Tobit my cousin!
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	3	And Raguel asked them, From whence are ye, brethren? To whomthey said, We are of the sons of Nephthalim, which are captivesin Nineve.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	4	Then he said to them, Do ye know Tobit our kinsman? And theysaid, We know him. Then said he, Is he in good health?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	5	And they said, He is both alive, and in good health: andTobias said, He is my father.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	6	Then Raguel leaped up, and kissed him, and wept,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	7	And blessed him, and said unto him, Thou art the son of anhonest and good man. But when he had heard that Tobit was blind,he was sorrowful, and wept.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	8	And likewise Edna his wife and Sara his daughter wept.Moreover they entertained them cheerfully; and after that theyhad killed a ram of the flock, they set store of meat on thetable. Then said Tobias to Raphael, Brother Azarias, speak ofthose things of which thou didst talk in the way, and let thisbusiness be dispatched.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	9	So he communicated the matter with Raguel: and Raguel said toTobias, Eat and drink, and make merry:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	10	For it is meet that thou shouldest marry my daughter:nevertheless I will declare unto thee the truth.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	11	I have given my daughter in marriage te seven men, who diedthat night they came in unto her: nevertheless for the presentbe merry. But Tobias said, I will eat nothing here, till weagree and swear one to another.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	12	Raguel said, Then take her from henceforth according to themanner, for thou art her cousin, and she is thine, and themerciful God give you good success in all things.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	13	Then he called his daughter Sara, and she came to her father,and he took her by the hand, and gave her to be wife to Tobias,saying, Behold, take her after the law of Moses, and lead heraway to thy father. And he blessed them;
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	14	And called Edna his wife, and took paper, and did write aninstrument of covenants, and sealed it.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	15	Then they began to eat.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	16	After Raguel called his wife Edna, and said unto her, Sister,prepare another chamber, and bring her in thither.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	17	Which when she had done as he had bidden her, she brought herthither: and she wept, and she received the tears of herdaughter, and said unto her,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	7	18	Be of good comfort, my daughter; the Lord of heaven and earthgive thee joy for this thy sorrow: be of good comfort, mydaughter.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	1	And when they had supped, they brought Tobias in unto her.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	2	And as he went, he remembered the words of Raphael, and tookthe ashes of the perfumes, and put the heart and the liver ofthe fish thereupon, and made a smoke therewith.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	3	The which smell when the evil spirit had smelled, he fledinto the utmost parts of Egypt, and the angel bound him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	4	And after that they were both shut in together, Tobias roseout of the bed, and said, Sister, arise, and let us pray thatGod would have pity on us.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	5	Then began Tobias to say, Blessed art thou, O God of ourfathers, and blessed is thy holy and glorious name for ever; letthe heavens bless thee, and all thy creatures.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	6	Thou madest Adam, and gavest him Eve his wife for an helperand stay: of them came mankind: thou hast said, It is not goodthat man should be alone; let us make unto him an aid like untohimself.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	7	And now, O Lord, I take not this my sister for lush butuprightly: therefore mercifully ordain that we may become agedtogether.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	8	And she said with him, Amen.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	9	So they slept both that night. And Raguel arose, and went andmade a grave,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	10	Saying, I fear lest he also be dead.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	11	But when Raguel was come into his house,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	12	He said unto his wife Edna. Send one of the maids, and lether see whether he be alive: if he be not, that we may bury him,and no man know it.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	13	So the maid opened the door, and went in, and found them bothasleep,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	14	And came forth, and told them that he was alive.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	15	Then Raguel praised God, and said, O God, thou art worthy tobe praised with all pure and holy praise; therefore let thysaints praise thee with all thy creatures; and let all thineangels and thine elect praise thee for ever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	16	Thou art to be praised, for thou hast made me joyful; andthat is not come to me which I suspected; but thou hast dealtwith us according to thy great mercy.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	17	Thou art to be praised because thou hast had mercy of twothat were the only begotten children of their fathers: grantthem mercy, O Lord, and finish their life in health with joy andmercy.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	18	Then Raguel bade his servants to fill the grave.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	19	And he kept the wedding feast fourteen days.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	20	For before the days of the marriage were finished, Raguel hadsaid unto him by an oath, that he should not depart till thefourteen days of the marriage were expired;
The Book of Tobit	Tob	8	21	And then he should take the half of his goods, and go insafety to his father; and should have the rest when I and mywife be dead.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	9	1	Then Tobias called Raphael, and said unto him,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	9	2	Brother Azarias, take with thee a servant, and two camels,and go to Rages of Media to Gabael, and bring me the money, andbring him to the wedding.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	9	3	For Raguel hath sworn that I shall not depart.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	9	4	But my father counteth the days; and if I tarry long, he willbe very sorry.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	9	5	So Raphael went out, and lodged with Gabael, and gave him thehandwriting: who brought forth bags which were sealed up, andgave them to him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	9	6	And early in the morning they went forth both together, andcame to the wedding: and Tobias blessed his wife.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	1	Now Tobit his father counted every day: and when the days ofthe journey were expired, and they came not,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	2	Then Tobit said, Are they detained? or is Gabael dead, andthere is no man to give him the money?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	3	Therefore he was very sorry.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	4	Then his wife said unto him, My son is dead, seeing hestayeth long; and she began to wail him, and said,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	5	Now I care for nothing, my son, since I have let thee go, thelight of mine eyes.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	6	To whom Tobit said, Hold thy peace, take no care, for he issafe.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	7	But she said, Hold thy peace, and deceive me not; my son isdead. And she went out every day into the way which they went,and did eat no meat on the daytime, and ceased not whole nightsto bewail her son Tobias, until the fourteen days of the weddingwere expired, which Raguel had sworn that he should spend there.Then Tobias said to Raguel, Let me go, for my father and mymother look no more to see me.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	8	But his father in law said unto him, Tarry with me, and Iwill send to thy father, and they shall declare unto him howthings go with thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	9	But Tobias said, No; but let me go to my father.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	10	Then Raguel arose, and gave him Sara his wife, and half hisgoods, servants, and cattle, and money:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	11	And he blessed them, and sent them away, saying, The God ofheaven give you a prosperous journey, my children.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	10	12	And he said to his daughter, Honour thy father and thy motherin law, which are now thy parents, that I may hear good reportof thee. And he kissed her. Edna also said to Tobias, The Lordof heaven restore thee, my dear brother, and grant that I maysee thy children of my daughter Sara before I die, that I mayrejoice before the Lord: behold, I commit my daughter unto theeof special trust; where are do not entreat her evil.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	1	After these things Tobias went his way, praising God that hehad given him a prosperous journey, and blessed Raguel and Ednahis wife, and went on his way till they drew near unto Nineve.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	2	Then Raphael said to Tobias, Thou knowest, brother, how thoudidst leave thy father:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	3	Let us haste before thy wife, and prepare the house.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	4	And take in thine hand the gall of the fish. So they wenttheir way, and the dog went after them.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	5	Now Anna sat looking about toward the way for her son.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	6	And when she espied him coming, she said to his father,Behold, thy son cometh, and the man that went with him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	7	Then said Raphael, I know, Tobias, that thy father will openhis eyes.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	8	Therefore anoint thou his eyes with the gall, and beingpricked therewith, he shall rub, and the whiteness shall fallaway, and he shall see thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	9	Then Anna ran forth, and fell upon the neck of her son, andsaid unto him, Seeing I have seen thee, my son, from henceforthI am content to die. And they wept both.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	10	Tobit also went forth toward the door, and stumbled: but hisson ran unto him,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	11	And took hold of his father: and he strake of the gall on hisfathers' eyes, saying, Be of good hope, my father.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	12	And when his eyes began to smart, he rubbed them;
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	13	And the whiteness pilled away from the corners of his eyes:and when he saw his son, he fell upon his neck.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	14	And he wept, and said, Blessed art thou, O God, and blessedis thy name for ever; and blessed are all thine holy angels:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	15	For thou hast scourged, and hast taken pity on me: for,behold, I see my son Tobias. And his son went in rejoicing, andtold his father the great things that had happened to him inMedia.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	16	Then Tobit went out to meet his daughter in law at the gateof Nineve, rejoicing and praising God: and they which saw him gomarvelled, because he had received his sight.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	17	But Tobias gave thanks before them, because God had mercy onhim. And when he came near to Sara his daughter in law, heblessed her, saying, Thou art welcome, daughter: God be blessed,which hath brought thee unto us, and blessed be thy father andthy mother. And there was joy among all his brethren which wereat Nineve.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	18	And Achiacharus, and Nasbas his brother's son, came:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	11	19	And Tobias' wedding was kept seven days with great joy.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	1	Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, My son,see that the man have his wages, which went with thee, and thoumust give him more.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	2	And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no harm to me togive him half of those things which I have brought:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	3	For he hath brought me again to thee in safety, and madewhole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healedthee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	4	Then the old man said, It is due unto him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	5	So he called the angel, and he said unto him, Take half ofall that ye have brought and go away in safety.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	6	Then he took them both apart, and said unto them, Bless God,praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the things whichhe hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is goodto praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forththe works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	7	It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it ishonourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good,and no evil shall touch you.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	8	Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. Alittle with righteousness is better than much withunrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	9	For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away allsin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filledwith life:
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	10	But they that sin are enemies to their own life.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	11	Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It wasgood to keep close the secret of a king, but that it washonourable to reveal the works of God.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	12	Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter inlaw, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the HolyOne: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with theelikewise.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	13	And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thydinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid fromme: but I was with thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	14	And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughterin law.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	15	I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present theprayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the gloryof the Holy One.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	16	Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: forthey feared.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	17	But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall go well withyou; praise God therefore.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	18	For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of our God Icame; wherefore praise him for ever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	19	All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eatnor drink, but ye did see a vision.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	20	Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sentme; but write all things which are done in a book.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	21	And when they arose, they saw him no more.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	12	22	Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, andhow the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	1	Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed beGod that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	2	For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell,and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid hishand.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	3	Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: forhe hath scattered us among them.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	4	There declare his greatness, and extol him before all theliving: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father forever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	5	And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will havemercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whomhe hath scattered us.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	6	If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your wholemind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn unto you,and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he willdo with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praisethe Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the landof my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might andmajesty to a sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justicebefore him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercyon you?
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	7	I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King ofheaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	8	Let all men speak, and let all praise him for hisrighteousness.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	9	O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thychildren's works, and will have mercy again on the sons of therighteous.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	10	Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise theeverlasting King, that his tabernacle may be builded in theeagain with joy, and let him make joyful there in thee those thatare captives, and love in thee for ever those that aremiserable.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	11	Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord Godwith gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; allgenerations shall praise thee with great joy.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	12	Cursed are all they which hate thee, and blessed shall all bewhich love thee for ever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	13	Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for theyshall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of thejust.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	14	O blessed are they which love thee, for they shall rejoice inthy peace: blessed are they which have been sorrowful for allthy scourges; for they shall rejoice for thee, when they haveseen all thy glory, and shall be glad for ever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	15	Let my soul bless God the great King.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	16	For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds,and precious stone: thy walls and towers and battlements withpure gold.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	17	And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl andcarbuncle and stones of Ophir.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	13	18	And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shallpraise him, saying, Blessed be God, which hath extolled it forever.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	1	So Tobit made an end of praising God.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	2	And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight,which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms,and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	3	And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons ofhis son, and said to him, My son, take thy children; for,behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	4	Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things whichJonas the prophet spake of Nineve, that it shall be overthrown;and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that ourbrethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that good land:and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in itshall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	5	And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring themagain into the land, where they shall build a temple, but notlike to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; andafterward they shall return from all places of their captivity,and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall bebuilt in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophetshave spoken thereof.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	6	And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, andshall bury their idols.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	7	So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shallconfess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all thosewhich love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice,shewing mercy to our brethren.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	8	And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that thosethings which the prophet Jonas spake shall surely come to pass.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	9	But keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyselfmerciful and just, that it may go well with thee.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	10	And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry nolonger at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharusthat brought him up, how out of light he brought him intodarkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus wassaved, but the other had his reward: for he went down intodarkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of deathwhich they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, andperished.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	11	Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and howrighteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, hegave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight andfifty years old; and he buried him honourably.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	12	And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with hisfather. But Tobias departed with his wife and children toEcbatane to Raguel his father in law,
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	13	Where he became old with honour, and he buried his father andmother in law honourably, and he inherited their substance, andhis father Tobit's.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	14	And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and sevenand twenty years old.
The Book of Tobit	Tob	14	15	But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve,which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before hisdeath he rejoiced over Nineve.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	1	In the twelfth year of the reign of Nabuchodonosor, whoreigned in Nineve, the great city; in the days of Arphaxad,which reigned over the Medes in Ecbatane,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	2	And built in Ecbatane walls round about of stones hewn threecubits broad and six cubits long, and made the height of thewall seventy cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	3	And set the towers thereof upon the gates of it an hundredcubits high, and the breadth thereof in the foundationthreescore cubits:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	4	And he made the gates thereof, even gates that were raised tothe height of seventy cubits, and the breadth of them was fortycubits, for the going forth of his mighty armies, and for thesetting in array of his footmen:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	5	Even in those days king Nabuchodonosor made war with kingArphaxad in the great plain, which is the plain in the bordersof Ragau.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	6	And there came unto him all they that dwelt in the hillcountry, and all that dwelt by Euphrates, and Tigris andHydaspes, and the plain of Arioch the king of the Elymeans, andvery many nations of the sons of Chelod, assembled themselves tothe battle.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	7	Then Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians sent unto all thatdwelt in Persia, and to all that dwelt westward, and to thosethat dwelt in Cilicia, and Damascus, and Libanus, andAntilibanus, and to all that dwelt upon the sea coast,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	8	And to those among the nations that were of Carmel, andGalaad, and the higher Galilee, and the great plain of Esdrelom,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	9	And to all that were in Samaria and the cities thereof, andbeyond Jordan unto Jerusalem, and Betane, and Chelus, and Kades,and the river of Egypt, and Taphnes, and Ramesse, and all theland of Gesem,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	10	Until ye come beyond Tanis and Memphis, and to all theinhabitants of Egypt, until ye come to the borders of Ethiopia.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	11	But all the inhabitants of the land made light of thecommandment of Nabuchodonosor king of the Assyrians, neitherwent they with him to the battle; for they were not afraid ofhim: yea, he was before them as one man, and they sent away hisambassadors from them without effect, and with disgrace.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	12	Therefore Nabuchodonosor was very angry with all thiscountry, and sware by his throne and kingdom, that he wouldsurely be avenged upon all those coasts of Cilicia, andDamascus, and Syria, and that he would slay with the sword allthe inhabitants of the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon,and all Judea, and all that were in Egypt, till ye come to theborders of the two seas.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	13	Then he marched in battle array with his power against kingArphaxad in the seventeenth year, and he prevailed in hisbattle: for he overthrew all the power of Arphaxad, and all hishorsemen, and all his chariots,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	14	And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, andtook the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned thebeauty thereof into shame.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	15	He took also Arphaxad in the mountains of Ragau, and smotehim through with his darts, and destroyed him utterly that day.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	1	16	So he returned afterward to Nineve, both he and all hiscompany of sundry nations being a very great multitude of men ofwar, and there he took his ease, and banqueted, both he and hisarmy, an hundred and twenty days.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	1	And in the eighteenth year, the two and twentieth day of thefirst month, there was talk in the house of Nabuchodonosor kingof the Assyrians that he should, as he said, avenge himself onall the earth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	2	So he called unto him all his officers, and all his nobles,and communicated with them his secret counsel, and concluded theafflicting of the whole earth out of his own mouth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	3	Then they decreed to destroy all flesh, that did not obey thecommandment of his mouth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	4	And when he had ended his counsel, Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians called Holofernes the chief captain of his army, whichwas next unto him, and said unto him.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	5	Thus saith the great king, the lord of the whole earth,Behold, thou shalt go forth from my presence, and take with theemen that trust in their own strength, of footmen an hundred andtwenty thousand; and the number of horses with their riderstwelve thousand.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	6	And thou shalt go against all the west country, because theydisobeyed my commandment.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	7	And thou shalt declare unto that they prepare for me earthand water: for I will go forth in my wrath against them and willcover the whole face of the earth with the feet of mine army,and I will give them for a spoil unto them:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	8	So that their slain shall fill their valleys and brooks andthe river shall be filled with their dead, till it overflow:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	9	And I will lead them captives to the utmost parts of all theearth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	10	Thou therefore shalt go forth. and take beforehand for me alltheir coasts: and if they will yield themselves unto thee, thoushalt reserve them for me till the day of their punishment.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	11	But concerning them that rebel, let not thine eye spare them;but put them to the slaughter, and spoil them wheresoever thougoest.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	12	For as I live, and by the power of my kingdom, whatsoever Ihave spoken, that will I do by mine hand.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	13	And take thou heed that thou transgress none of thecommandments of thy lord, but accomplish them fully, as I havecommanded thee, and defer not to do them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	14	Then Holofernes went forth from the presence of his lord, andcalled ail the governors and captains, and the officers of thearmy of Assur;
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	15	And he mustered the chosen men for the battle, as his lordhad commanded him, unto an hundred and twenty thousand, andtwelve thousand archers on horseback;
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	16	And he ranged them, as a great army is ordered for the war.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	17	And he took camels and asses for their carriages, a verygreat number; and sheep and oxen and goats without number fortheir provision:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	18	And plenty of victual for every man of the army, and verymuch gold and silver out of the king's house.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	19	Then he went forth and all his power to go before kingNabuchodonosor in the voyage, and to cover all the face of theearth westward with their chariots, and horsemen, and theirchosen footmen.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	20	A great number also sundry countries came with them likelocusts, and like the sand of the earth: for the multitude waswithout number.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	21	And they went forth of Nineve three days' journey toward theplain of Bectileth, and pitched from Bectileth near the mountainwhich is at the left hand of the upper Cilicia.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	22	Then he took all his army, his footmen, and horsemen andchariots, and went from thence into the hill country;
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	23	And destroyed Phud and Lud, and spoiled all the children ofRasses, and the children of Israel, which were toward thewilderness at the south of the land of the Chellians.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	24	Then he went over Euphrates, and went through Mesopotamia,and destroyed all the high cities that were upon the riverArbonai, till ye come to the sea.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	25	And he took the borders of Cilicia, and killed all thatresisted him, and came to the borders of Japheth, which weretoward the south, over against Arabia.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	26	He compassed also all the children of Madian, and burned uptheir tabernacles, and spoiled their sheepcotes.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	27	Then he went down into the plain of Damascus in the time ofwheat harvest, and burnt up all their fields, and destroyedtheir flocks and herds, also he spoiled their cities, andutterly wasted their countries, and smote all their young menwith the edge of the sword.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	2	28	Therefore the fear and dread of him fell upon all theinhabitants of the sea coasts, which were in Sidon and Tyrus,and them that dwelt in Sur and Ocina, and all that dwelt inJemnaan; and they that dwelt in Azotus and Ascalon feared himgreatly.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	1	So they sent ambassadors unto him to treat of peace, saying,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	2	Behold, we the servants of Nabuchodonosor the great king liebefore thee; use us as shall be good in thy sight.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	3	Behold, our houses, and all our places, and all our fields ofwheat, and flocks, and herds, and all the lodges of our tentslie before thy face; use them as it pleaseth thee.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	4	Behold, even our cities and the inhabitants thereof are thyservants; come and deal with them as seemeth good unto thee.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	5	So the men came to Holofernes, and declared unto him afterthis manner.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	6	Then came he down toward the sea coast, both he and his army,and set garrisons in the high cities, and took out of themchosen men for aid.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	7	So they and all the country round about received them withgarlands, with dances, and with timbrels.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	8	Yet he did cast down their frontiers, and cut down theirgroves: for he had decreed to destroy all the gods of the land,that all nations should worship Nabuchodonosor only, and thatall tongues and tribes should call upon him as god.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	9	Also he came over against Esdraelon near unto Judea, overagainst the great strait of Judea.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	3	10	And he pitched between Geba and Scythopolis, and there hetarried a whole month, that he might gather together all thecarriages of his army.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	1	Now the children of Israel, that dwelt in Judea, heard allthat Holofernes the chief captain of Nabuchodonosor king of theAssyrians had done to the nations, and after what manner he hadspoiled all their temples, and brought them to nought.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	2	Therefore they were exceedingly afraid of him, and weretroubled for Jerusalem, and for the temple of the Lord their God:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	3	For they were newly returned from the captivity, and all thepeople of Judea were lately gathered together: and the vessels,and the altar, and the house, were sanctified after theprofanation.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	4	Therefore they sent into all the coasts of Samaria, and thevillages and to Bethoron, and Belmen, and Jericho, and to Choba,and Esora, and to the valley of Salem:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	5	And possessed themselves beforehand of all the tops of thehigh mountains, and fortified the villages that were in them,and laid up victuals for the provision of war: for their fieldswere of late reaped.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	6	Also Joacim the high priest, which was in those days inJerusalem, wrote to them that dwelt in Bethulia, andBetomestham, which is over against Esdraelon toward the opencountry, near to Dothaim,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	7	Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: forby them there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy tostop them that would come up, because the passage was straight,for two men at the most.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	8	And the children of Israel did as Joacim the high priest hadcommanded them, with the ancients of all the people of Israel,which dwelt at Jerusalem.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	9	Then every man of Israel cried to God with great fervency,and with great vehemency did they humble their souls:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	10	Both they, and their wives and their children, and theircattle, and every stranger and hireling, and their servantsbought with money, put sackcloth upon their loins.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	11	Thus every man and women, and the little children, and theinhabitants of Jerusalem, fell before the temple, and cast ashesupon their heads, and spread out their sackcloth before the faceof the Lord: also they put sackcloth about the altar,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	12	And cried to the God of Israel all with one consentearnestly, that he would not give their children for a prey, andtheir wives for a spoil, and the cities of their inheritance todestruction, and the sanctuary to profanation and reproach, andfor the nations to rejoice at.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	13	So God heard their prayers, and looked upon theirafflictions: for the people fasted many days in all Judea andJerusalem before the sanctuary of the Lord Almighty.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	14	And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stoodbefore the Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, hadtheir loins girt with sackcloth, and offered the daily burntofferings, with the vows and free gifts of the people,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	4	15	And had ashes on their mitres, and cried unto the Lord withall their power, that he would look upon all the house of Israelgraciously.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	1	Then was it declared to Holofernes, the chief captain of thearmy of Assur, that the children of Israel had prepared for war,and had shut up the passages of the hill country, and hadfortified all the tops of the high hills and had laidimpediments in the champaign countries:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	2	Wherewith he was very angry, and called all the princes ofMoab, and the captains of Ammon, and all the governors of thesea coast,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	3	And he said unto them, Tell me now, ye sons of Chanaan, whothis people is, that dwelleth in the hill country, and what arethe cities that they inhabit, and what is the multitude of theirarmy, and wherein is their power and strength, and what king isset over them, or captain of their army;
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	4	And why have they determined not to come and meet me, morethan all the inhabitants of the west.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	5	Then said Achior, the captain of all the sons of Ammon, Letmy lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant, and Iwill declare unto thee the truth concerning this people, whichdwelleth near thee, and inhabiteth the hill countries: and thereshall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	6	This people are descended of the Chaldeans:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	7	And they sojourned heretofore in Mesopotamia, because theywould not follow the gods of their fathers, which were in theland of Chaldea.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	8	For they left the way of their ancestors, and worshipped theGod of heaven, the God whom they knew: so they cast them outfrom the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia, andsojourned there many days.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	9	Then their God commanded them to depart from the place wherethey sojourned, and to go into the land of Chanaan: where theydwelt, and were increased with gold and silver, and with verymuch cattle.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	10	But when a famine covered all the land of Chanaan, they wentdown into Egypt, and sojourned there, while they were nourished,and became there a great multitude, so that one could not numbertheir nation.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	11	Therefore the king of Egypt rose up against them, and dealtsubtilly with them, and brought them low with labouring inbrick, and made them slaves.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	12	Then they cried unto their God, and he smote all the land ofEgypt with incurable plagues: so the Egyptians cast them out oftheir sight.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	13	And God dried the Red sea before them,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	14	And brought them to mount Sina, and Cades-Barne, and castforth all that dwelt in the wilderness.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	15	So they dwelt in the land of the Amorites, and they destroyedby their strength all them of Esebon, and passing over Jordanthey possessed all the hill country.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	16	And they cast forth before them the Chanaanite, thePherezite, the Jebusite, and the Sychemite, and all theGergesites, and they dwelt in that country many days.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	17	And whilst they sinned not before their God, they prospered,because the God that hateth iniquity was with them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	18	But when they departed from the way which he appointed them,they were destroyed in many battles very sore, and were ledcaptives into a land that was not their's, and the temple oftheir God was cast to the ground, and their cities were taken bythe enemies.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	19	But now are they returned to their God, and are come up fromthe places where they were scattered, and have possessedJerusalem, where their sanctuary is, and are seated in the hillcountry; for it was desolate.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	20	Now therefore, my lord and governor, if there be any erroragainst this people, and they sin against their God, let usconsider that this shall be their ruin, and let us go up, and weshall overcome them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	21	But if there be no iniquity in their nation, let my lord nowpass by, lest their Lord defend them, and their God be for them,and we become a reproach before all the world.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	22	And when Achior had finished these sayings, all the peoplestanding round about the tent murmured, and the chief men ofHolofernes, and all that dwelt by the sea side, and in Moab,spake that he should kill him.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	23	For, say they, we will not be afraid of the face of thechildren of Israel: for, lo, it is a people that have nostrength nor power for a strong battle
The Book of Judith	Jdt	5	24	Now therefore, lord Holofernes, we will go up, and they shallbe a prey to be devoured of all thine army.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	1	And when the tumult of men that were about the council wasceased, Holofernes the chief captain of the army of Assur saidunto Achior and all the Moabites before all the company of othernations,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	2	And who art thou, Achior, and the hirelings of Ephraim, thatthou hast prophesied against us as to day, and hast said, thatwe should not make war with the people of Israel, because theirGod will defend them? and who is God but Nabuchodonosor?
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	3	He will send his power, and will destroy them from the faceof the earth, and their God shall not deliver them: but we hisservants will destroy them as one man; for they are not able tosustain the power of our horses.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	4	For with them we will tread them under foot, and theirmountains shall be drunken with their blood, and their fieldsshall be filled with their dead bodies, and their footstepsshall not be able to stand before us, for they shall utterlyperish, saith king Nabuchodonosor, lord of all the earth: for hesaid, None of my words shall be in vain.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	5	And thou, Achior, an hireling of Ammon, which hast spokenthese words in the day of thine iniquity, shalt see my face nomore from this day, until I take vengeance of this nation thatcame out of Egypt.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	6	And then shall the sword of mine army, and the multitude ofthem that serve me, pass through thy sides, and thou shalt fallamong their slain, when I return.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	7	Now therefore my servants shall bring thee back into the hillcountry, and shall set thee in one of the cities of thepassages:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	8	And thou shalt not perish, till thou be destroyed with them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	9	And if thou persuade thyself in thy mind that they shall betaken, let not thy countenance fall: I have spoken it, and noneof my words shall be in vain.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	10	Then Holofernes commanded his servants, that waited in histent, to take Achior, and bring him to Bethulia, and deliver himinto the hands of the children of Israel.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	11	So his servants took him, and brought him out of the campinto the plain, and they went from the midst of the plain intothe hill country, and came unto the fountains that were underBethulia.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	12	And when the men of the city saw them, they took up theirweapons, and went out of the city to the top of the hill: andevery man that used a sling kept them from coming up by castingof stones against them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	13	Nevertheless having gotten privily under the hill, they boundAchior, and cast him down, and left him at the foot of the hill,and returned to their lord.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	14	But the Israelites descended from their city, and came untohim, and loosed him, and brought him to Bethulia, and presentedhim to the governors of the city:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	15	Which were in those days Ozias the son of Micha, of the tribeof Simeon, and Chabris the son of Gothoniel, and Charmis the sonof Melchiel.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	16	And they called together all the ancients of the city, andall their youth ran together, and their women, to the assembly,and they set Achior in the midst of all their people. Then Oziasasked him of that which was done.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	17	And he answered and declared unto them the words of thecouncil of Holofernes, and all the words that he had spoken inthe midst of the princes of Assur, and whatsoever Holofernes hadspoken proudly against the house of Israel.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	18	Then the people fell down and worshipped God, and cried untoGod. saying,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	19	O Lord God of heaven, behold their pride, and pity the lowestate of our nation, and look upon the face of those that aresanctified unto thee this day.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	20	Then they comforted Achior, and praised him greatly.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	6	21	And Ozias took him out of the assembly unto his house, andmade a feast to the elders; and they called on the God of Israelall that night for help.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	1	The next day Holofernes commanded all his army, and all hispeople which were come to take his part, that they should removetheir camp against Bethulia, to take aforehand the ascents ofthe hill country, and to make war against the children ofIsrael.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	2	Then their strong men removed their camps in that day, andthe army of the men of war was an hundred and seventy thousandfootmen, and twelve thousand horsemen, beside the baggage, andother men that were afoot among them, a very great multitude.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	3	And they camped in the valley near unto Bethulia, by thefountain, and they spread themselves in breadth over Dothaimeven to Belmaim, and in length from Bethulia unto Cynamon, whichis over against Esdraelon.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	4	Now the children of Israel, when they saw the multitude ofthem, were greatly troubled, and said every one to hisneighbour, Now will these men lick up the face of the earth; forneither the high mountains, nor the valleys, nor the hills, areable to bear their weight.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	5	Then every man took up his weapons of war, and when they hadkindled fires upon their towers, they remained and watched allthat night.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	6	But in the second day Holofernes brought forth all hishorsemen in the sight of the children of Israel which were inBethulia,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	7	And viewed the passages up to the city, and came to thefountains of their waters, and took them, and set garrisons ofmen of war over them, and he himself removed toward his people.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	8	Then came unto him all the chief of the children of Esau, andall the governors of the people of Moab, and the captains of thesea coast, and said,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	9	Let our lord now hear a word, that there be not an overthrowin thine army.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	10	For this people of the children of Israel do not trust intheir spears, but in the height of the mountains wherein theydwell, because it is not easy to come up to the tops of theirmountains.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	11	Now therefore, my lord, fight not against them in battlearray, and there shall not so much as one man of thy peopleperish.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	12	Remain in thy camp, and keep all the men of thine army, andlet thy servants get into their hands the fountain of water,which issueth forth of the foot of the mountain:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	13	For all the inhabitants of Bethulia have their water thence;so shall thirst kill them, and they shall give up their city,and we and our people shall go up to the tops of the mountainsthat are near, and will camp upon them, to watch that none goout of the city.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	14	So they and their wives and their children shall be consumedwith fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall beoverthrown in the streets where they dwell.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	15	Thus shalt thou render them an evil reward; because theyrebelled, and met not thy person peaceably.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	16	And these words pleased Holofernes and all his servants, andhe appointed to do as they had spoken.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	17	So the camp of the children of Ammon departed, and with themfive thousand of the Assyrians, and they pitched in the valley,and took the waters, and the fountains of the waters of thechildren of Israel.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	18	Then the children of Esau went up with the children of Ammon,and camped in the hill country over against Dothaim: and theysent some of them toward the south, and toward the east overagainst Ekrebel, which is near unto Chusi, that is upon thebrook Mochmur; and the rest of the army of the Assyrians campedin the plain, and covered the face of the whole land; and theirtents and carriages were pitched to a very great multitude.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	19	Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord their God,because their heart failed, for all their enemies had compassedthem round about, and there was no way to escape out from amongthem.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	20	Thus all the company of Assur remained about them, both theirfootmen, chariots, and horsemen, four and thirty days, so thatall their vessels of water failed all the inhibitants ofBethulia.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	21	And the cisterns were emptied, and they had not water todrink their fill for one day; for they gave them drink bymeasure.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	22	Therefore their young children were out of heart, and theirwomen and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in thestreets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and therewas no longer any strength in them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	23	Then all the people assembled to Ozias, and to the chief ofthe city, both young men, and women, and children, and criedwith a loud voice, and said before all the elders,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	24	God be judge between us and you: for ye have done us greatinjury, in that ye have not required peace of the children ofAssur.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	25	For now we have no helper: but God hath sold us into theirhands, that we should be thrown down before them with thirst andgreat destruction.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	26	Now therefore call them unto you, and deliver the whole cityfor a spoil to the people of Holofernes, and to all his army.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	27	For it is better for us to be made a spoil unto them, than todie for thirst: for we will be his servants, that our souls maylive, and not see the death of our infants before our eyes, norour wives nor our children to die.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	28	We take to witness against you the heaven and the earth, andour God and Lord of our fathers, which punisheth us according toour sins and the sins of our fathers, that he do not accordingas we have said this day.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	29	Then there was great weeping with one consent in the midst ofthe assembly; and they cried unto the Lord God with a loudvoice.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	30	Then said Ozias to them, Brethren, be of good courage, let usyet endure five days, in the which space the Lord our God mayturn his mercy toward us; for he will not forsake us utterly.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	31	And if these days pass, and there come no help unto us, Iwill do according to your word.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	7	32	And he dispersed the people, every one to their own charge;and they went unto the walls and towers of their city, and sentthe women and children into their houses: and they were very lowbrought in the city.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	1	Now at that time Judith heard thereof, which was the daughterof Merari, the son of Ox, the son of Joseph, the son of Ozel,the son of Elcia, the son of Ananias, the son of Gedeon, the sonof Raphaim, the son of Acitho, the son of Eliu, the son ofEliab, the son of Nathanael, the son of Samael, the son ofSalasadal, the son of Israel.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	2	And Manasses was her husband, of her tribe and kindred, whodied in the barley harvest.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	3	For as he stood overseeing them that bound sheaves in thefield, the heat came upon his head, and he fell on his bed, anddied in the city of Bethulia: and they buried him with hisfathers in the field between Dothaim and Balamo.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	4	So Judith was a widow in her house three years and fourmonths.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	5	And she made her a tent upon the top of her house, and put onsackcloth upon her loins and ware her widow's apparel.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	6	And she fasted all the days of her widowhood, save the evesof the sabbaths, and the sabbaths, and the eves of the newmoons, and the new moons and the feasts and solemn days of thehouse of Israel.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	7	She was also of a goodly countenance, and very beautiful tobehold: and her husband Manasses had left her gold, and silver,and menservants and maidservants, and cattle, and lands; and sheremained upon them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	8	And there was none that gave her an ill word; ar she fearedGod greatly.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	9	Now when she heard the evil words of the people against thegovernor, that they fainted for lack of water; for Judith hadheard all the words that Ozias had spoken unto them, and that hehad sworn to deliver the city unto the Assyrians after fivedays;
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	10	Then she sent her waitingwoman, that had the government ofall things that she had, to call Ozias and Chabris and Charmis,the ancients of the city.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	11	And they came unto her, and she said unto them, Hear me now,O ye governors of the inhabitants of Bethulia: for your wordsthat ye have spoken before the people this day are not right,touching this oath which ye made and pronounced between God andyou, and have promised to deliver the city to our enemies,unless within these days the Lord turn to help you.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	12	And now who are ye that have tempted God this day, and standinstead of God among the children of men?
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	13	And now try the Lord Almighty, but ye shall never know anything.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	14	For ye cannot find the depth of the heart of man, neither canye perceive the things that he thinketh: then how can ye searchout God, that hath made all these things, and know his mind, orcomprehend his purpose? Nay, my brethren, provoke not the Lordour God to anger.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	15	For if he will not help us within these five days, he hathpower to defend us when he will, even every day, or to destroyus before our enemies.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	16	Do not bind the counsels of the Lord our God: for God is notas man, that he may be threatened; neither is he as the son ofman, that he should be wavering.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	17	Therefore let us wait for salvation of him, and call upon himto help us, and he will hear our voice, if it please him.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	18	For there arose none in our age, neither is there any now inthese days neither tribe, nor family, nor people, nor city amongus, which worship gods made with hands, as hath been aforetime.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	19	For the which cause our fathers were given to the sword, andfor a spoil, and had a great fall before our enemies.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	20	But we know none other god, therefore we trust that he willnot dispise us, nor any of our nation.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	21	For if we be taken so, all Judea shall lie waste, and oursanctuary shall be spoiled; and he will require the profanationthereof at our mouth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	22	And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of thecountry, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turnupon our heads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be inbondage; and we shall be an offence and a reproach to all themthat possess us.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	23	For our servitude shall not be directed to favour: but theLord our God shall turn it to dishonour.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	24	Now therefore, O brethren, let us shew an example to ourbrethren, because their hearts depend upon us, and thesanctuary, and the house, and the altar, rest upon us.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	25	Moreover let us give thanks to the Lord our God, which triethus, even as he did our fathers.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	26	Remember what things he did to Abraham, and how he triedIsaac, and what happened to Jacob in Mesopotamia of Syria, whenhe kept the sheep of Laban his mother's brother.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	27	For he hath not tried us in the fire, as he did them, for theexamination of their hearts, neither hath he taken vengeance onus: but the Lord doth scourge them that come near unto him, toadmonish them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	28	Then said Ozias to her, All that thou hast spoken hast thouspoken with a good heart, and there is none that may gainsay thywords.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	29	For this is not the first day wherein thy wisdom ismanifested; but from the beginning of thy days all the peoplehave known thy understanding, because the disposition of thineheart is good.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	30	But the people were very thirsty, and compelled us to do untothem as we have spoken, and to bring an oath upon ourselves,which we will not break.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	31	Therefore now pray thou for us, because thou art a godlywoman, and the Lord will send us rain to fill our cisterns, andwe shall faint no more.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	32	Then said Judith unto them, Hear me, and I will do a thing,which shall go throughout all generations to the children of ournation.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	33	Ye shall stand this night in the gate, and I will go forthwith my waitingwoman: and within the days that ye have promisedto deliver the city to our enemies the Lord will visit Israel bymine hand.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	34	But enquire not ye of mine act: for I will not declare itunto you, till the things be finished that I do.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	35	Then said Ozias and the princes unto her, Go in peace, andthe Lord God be before thee, to take vengeance on our enemies.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	8	36	So they returned from the tent, and went to their wards.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	1	Judith fell upon her face, and put ashes upon her head, anduncovered the sackcloth wherewith she was clothed; and about thetime that the incense of that evening was offered in Jerusalemin the house of the Lord Judith cried with a loud voice, andsaid,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	2	O Lord God of my father Simeon, to whom thou gavest a swordto take vengeance of the strangers, who loosened the girdle of amaid to defile her, and discovered the thigh to her shame, andpolluted her virginity to her reproach; for thou saidst, Itshall not be so; and yet they did so:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	3	Wherefore thou gavest their rulers to be slain, so that theydyed their bed in blood, being deceived, and smotest theservants with their lords, and the lords upon their thrones;
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	4	And hast given their wives for a prey, and their daughters tobe captives, and all their spoils to be divided among thy dearchildren; which were moved with thy zeal, and abhorred thepollution of their blood, and called upon thee for aid: O God, Omy God, hear me also a widow.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	5	For thou hast wrought not only those things, but also thethings which fell out before, and which ensued after; thou hastthought upon the things which are now, and which are to come.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	6	Yea, what things thou didst determine were ready at hand, andsaid, Lo, we are here: for all thy ways are prepared, and thyjudgments are in thy foreknowledge.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	7	For, behold, the Assyrians are multiplied in their power;they are exalted with horse and man; they glory in the strengthof their footmen; they trust in shield, and spear, and bow, andsling; and know not that thou art the Lord that breakest thebattles: the Lord is thy name.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	8	Throw down their strength in thy power, and bring down theirforce in thy wrath: for they have purposed to defile thysanctuary, and to pollute the tabernacle where thy glorious nameresteth and to cast down with sword the horn of thy altar.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	9	Behold their pride, and send thy wrath upon their heads: giveinto mine hand, which am a widow, the power that I haveconceived.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	10	Smite by the deceit of my lips the servant with the prince,and the prince with the servant: break down their stateliness bythe hand of a woman.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	11	For thy power standeth not in multitude nor thy might instrong men: for thou art a God of the afflicted, an helper ofthe oppressed, an upholder of the weak, a protector of theforlorn, a saviour of them that are without hope.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	12	I pray thee, I pray thee, O God of my father, and God of theinheritance of Israel, Lord of the heavens and earth, Creator ofthe waters, king of every creature, hear thou my prayer:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	13	And make my speech and deceit to be their wound and stripe,who have purposed cruel things against thy covenant, and thyhallowed house, and against the top of Sion, and against thehouse of the possession of thy children.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	9	14	And make every nation and tribe to acknowledge that thou artthe God of all power and might, and that there is none otherthat protecteth the people of Israel but thou.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	1	Now after that she had ceased to cry unto the God of Israel,and bad made an end of all these words.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	2	She rose where she had fallen down, and called her maid, andwent down into the house in the which she abode in the sabbathdays, and in her feast days,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	3	And pulled off the sackcloth which she had on, and put offthe garments of her widowhood, and washed her body all over withwater, and anointed herself with precious ointment, and braidedthe hair of her head, and put on a tire upon it, and put on hergarments of gladness, wherewith she was clad during the life ofManasses her husband.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	4	And she took sandals upon her feet, and put about her herbracelets, and her chains, and her rings, and her earrings, andall her ornaments, and decked herself bravely, to allure theeyes of all men that should see her.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	5	Then she gave her maid a bottle of wine, and a cruse of oil,and filled a bag with parched corn, and lumps of figs, and withfine bread; so she folded all these things together, and laidthem upon her.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	6	Thus they went forth to the gate of the city of Bethulia, andfound standing there Ozias and the ancients of the city, Chabrisand Charmis.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	7	And when they saw her, that her countenance was altered, andher apparel was changed, they wondered at her beauty verygreatly, and said unto her.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	8	The God, the God of our fathers give thee favour, andaccomplish thine enterprizes to the glory of the children ofIsrael, and to the exaltation of Jerusalem. Then they worshippedGod.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	9	And she said unto them, Command the gates of the city to beopened unto me, that I may go forth to accomplish the thingswhereof ye have spoken with me. So they commanded the young mento open unto her, as she had spoken.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	10	And when they had done so, Judith went out, she, and her maidwith her; and the men of the city looked after her, until shewas gone down the mountain, and till she had passed the valley,and could see her no more.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	11	Thus they went straight forth in the valley: and the firstwatch of the Assyrians met her,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	12	And took her, and asked her, Of what people art thou? andwhence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she said, I am awoman of the Hebrews, and am fled from them: for they shall begiven you to be consumed:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	13	And I am coming before Holofernes the chief captain of yourarmy, to declare words of truth; and I will shew him a way,whereby he shall go, and win all the hill country, withoutlosing the body or life of any one of his men.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	14	Now when the men heard her words, and beheld her countenance,they wondered greatly at her beauty, and said unto her,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	15	Thou hast saved thy life, in that thou hast hasted to comedown to the presence of our lord: now therefore come to histent, and some of us shall conduct thee, until they havedelivered thee to his hands.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	16	And when thou standest before him, be not afraid in thineheart, but shew unto him according to thy word; and he willentreat thee well.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	17	Then they chose out of them an hundred men to accompany herand her maid; and they brought her to the tent of Holofernes.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	18	Then was there a concourse throughout all the camp: for hercoming was noised among the tents, and they came about her, asshe stood without the tent of Holofernes, till they told him ofher.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	19	And they wondered at her beauty, and admired the children ofIsrael because of her, and every one said to his neighbour, Whowould despise this people, that have among them such women?surely it is not good that one man of them be left who being letgo might deceive the whole earth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	20	And they that lay near Holofernes went out, and all hisservants and they brought her into the tent.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	21	Now Holofernes rested upon his bed under a canopy, which waswoven with purple, and gold, and emeralds, and precious stones.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	22	So they shewed him of her; and he came out before his tentwith silver lamps going before him.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	10	23	And when Judith was come before him and his servants they allmarvelled at the beauty of her countenance; and she fell downupon her face, and did reverence unto him: and his servants tookher up.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	1	Then said Holofernes unto her, Woman, be of good comfort,fear not in thine heart: for I never hurt any that was willingto serve Nabuchodonosor, the king of all the earth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	2	Now therefore, if thy people that dwelleth in the mountainshad not set light by me, I would not have lifted up my spearagainst them: but they have done these things to themselves.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	3	But now tell me wherefore thou art fled from them, and artcome unto us: for thou art come for safeguard; be of goodcomfort, thou shalt live this night, and hereafter:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	4	For none shall hurt thee, but entreat thee well, as they dothe servants of king Nabuchodonosor my lord.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	5	Then Judith said unto him, Receive the words of thy servant,and suffer thine handmaid to speak in thy presence, and I willdeclare no lie to my lord this night.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	6	And if thou wilt follow the words of thine handmaid, God willbring the thing perfectly to pass by thee; and my lord shall notfail of his purposes.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	7	As Nabuchodonosor king of all the earth liveth, and as hispower liveth, who hath sent thee for the upholding of everyliving thing: for not only men shall serve him by thee, but alsothe beasts of the field, and the cattle, and the fowls of theair, shall live by thy power under Nabuchodonosor and all hishouse.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	8	For we have heard of thy wisdom and thy policies, and it isreported in all the earth, that thou only art excellent in allthe kingdom, and mighty in knowledge, and wonderful in feats ofwar.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	9	Now as concerning the matter, which Achior did speak in thycouncil, we have heard his words; for the men of Bethulia savedhim, and he declared unto them all that he had spoken unto thee.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	10	Therefore, O lord and governor, respect not his word; but layit up in thine heart, for it is true: for our nation shall notbe punished, neither can sword prevail against them, except theysin against their God.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	11	And now, that my lord be not defeated and frustrate of hispurpose, even death is now fallen upon them, and their sin hathovertaken them, wherewith they will provoke their God to angerwhensoever they shall do that which is not fit to be done:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	12	For their victuals fail them, and all their water is scant,and they have determined to lay hands upon their cattle, andpurposed to consume all those things, that God hath forbiddenthem to eat by his laws:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	13	And are resolved to spend the firstfruits of the the tenthsof wine and oil, which they had sanctified, and reserved for thepriests that serve in Jerusalem before the face of our God; thewhich things it is not lawful for any of the people so much asto touch with their hands.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	14	For they have sent some to Jerusalem, because they also thatdwell there have done the like, to bring them a licence from thesenate.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	15	Now when they shall bring them word, they will forthwith doit, and they shall be given to thee to be destroyed the sameday.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	16	Wherefore I thine handmaid, knowing all this, am fled fromtheir presence; and God hath sent me to work things with thee,whereat all the earth shall be astonished, and whosoever shallhear it.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	17	For thy servant is religious, and serveth the God of heavenday and night: now therefore, my lord, I will remain with thee,and thy servant will go out by night into the valley, and I willpray unto God, and he will tell me when they have committedtheir sins:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	18	And I will come and shew it unto thee: then thou shalt goforth with all thine army, and there shall be none of them thatshall resist thee.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	19	And I will lead thee through the midst of Judea, until thoucome before Jerusalem; and I will set thy throne in the midstthereof; and thou shalt drive them as sheep that have noshepherd, and a dog shall not so much as open his mouth at thee:for these things were told me according to my foreknowledge, andthey were declared unto me, and I am sent to tell thee.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	20	Then her words pleased Holofernes and all his servants; andthey marvelled at her wisdom, and said,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	21	There is not such a woman from one end of the earth to theother, both for beauty of face, and wisdom of words.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	22	Likewise Holofernes said unto her. God hath done well to sendthee before the people, that strength might be in our hands anddestruction upon them that lightly regard my lord.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	11	23	And now thou art both beautiful in thy countenance, and wittyin thy words: surely if thou do as thou hast spoken thy Godshall be my God, and thou shalt dwell in the house of kingNabuchodonosor, and shalt be renowned through the whole earth.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	1	Then he commanded to bring her in where his plate was set;and bade that they should prepare for her of his own meats, andthat she should drink of his own wine.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	2	And Judith said, I will not eat thereof, lest there be anoffence: but provision shall be made for me of the things that Ihave brought.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	3	Then Holofernes said unto her, If thy provision should fail,how should we give thee the like? for there be none with us ofthy nation.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	4	Then said Judith unto him As thy soul liveth, my lord, thinehandmaid shall not spend those things that I have, before theLord work by mine hand the things that he hath determined.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	5	Then the servants of Holofernes brought her into the tent,and she slept till midnight, and she arose when it was towardthe morning watch,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	6	And sent to Holofernes, saving, Let my lord now command thatthine handmaid may go forth unto prayer.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	7	Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stayher: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in thenight into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in afountain of water by the camp.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	8	And when she came out, she besought the Lord God of Israel todirect her way to the raising up of the children of her people.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	9	So she came in clean, and remained in the tent, until she dideat her meat at evening.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	10	And in the fourth day Holofernes made a feast to his ownservants only, and called none of the officers to the banquet.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	11	Then said he to Bagoas the eunuch, who had charge over allthat he had, Go now, and persuade this Hebrew woman which iswith thee, that she come unto us, and eat and drink with us.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	12	For, lo, it will be a shame for our person, if we shall letsuch a woman go, not having had her company; for if we draw hernot unto us, she will laugh us to scorn.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	13	Then went Bagoas from the presence of Holofernes, and came toher, and he said, Let not this fair damsel fear to come to mylord, and to be honoured in his presence, and drink wine, and bemerry with us and be made this day as one of the daughters ofthe Assyrians, which serve in the house of Nabuchodonosor.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	14	Then said Judith unto him, Who am I now, that I shouldgainsay my lord? surely whatsoever pleaseth him I will dospeedily, and it shall be my joy unto the day of my death.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	15	So she arose, and decked herself with her apparel and all herwoman's attire, and her maid went and laid soft skins on theground for her over against Holofernes, which she had receivedof Bagoas far her daily use, that she might sit and eat uponthem.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	16	Now when Judith came in and sat down, Holofernes his heartwas ravished with her, and his mind was moved, and he desiredgreatly her company; for he waited a time to deceive her, fromthe day that he had seen her.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	17	Then said Holofernes unto her, Drink now, and be merry withus.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	18	So Judith said, I will drink now, my lord, because my life ismagnified in me this day more than all the days since I wasborn.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	19	Then she took and ate and drank before him what her maid hadprepared.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	12	20	And Holofernes took great delight in her, and drank more winethan he had drunk at any time in one day since he was born.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	1	Now when the evening was come, his servants made haste todepart, and Bagoas shut his tent without, and dismissed thewaiters from the presence of his lord; and they went to theirbeds: for they were all weary, because the feast had been long.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	2	And Judith was left along in the tent, and Holofernes lyingalong upon his bed: for he was filled with wine.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	3	Now Judith had commanded her maid to stand without herbedchamber, and to wait for her. coming forth, as she did daily:for she said she would go forth to her prayers, and she spake toBagoas according to the same purpose.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	4	So all went forth and none was left in the bedchamber,neither little nor great. Then Judith, standing by his bed, saidin her heart, O Lord God of all power, look at this present uponthe works of mine hands for the exaltation of Jerusalem.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	5	For now is the time to help thine inheritance, and to executethine enterprizes to the destruction of the enemies which arerisen against us.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	6	Then she came to the pillar of the bed, which was atHolofernes' head, and took down his fauchion from thence,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	7	And approached to his bed, and took hold of the hair of hishead, and said, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Israel, this day.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	8	And she smote twice upon his neck with all her might, and shetook away his head from him.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	9	And tumbled his body down from the bed, and pulled down thecanopy from the pillars; and anon after she went forth, and gaveHolofernes his head to her maid;
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	10	And she put it in her bag of meat: so they twain wenttogether according to their custom unto prayer: and when theypassed the camp, they compassed the valley, and went up themountain of Bethulia, and came to the gates thereof.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	11	Then said Judith afar off, to the watchmen at the gate, Open,open now the gate: God, even our God, is with us, to shew hispower yet in Jerusalem, and his forces against the enemy, as hehath even done this day.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	12	Now when the men of her city heard her voice, they made hasteto go down to the gate of their city, and they called the eldersof the city.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	13	And then they ran all together, both small and great, for itwas strange unto them that she was come: so they opened thegate, and received them, and made a fire for a light, and stoodround about them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	14	Then she said to them with a loud voice, Praise, praise God,praise God, I say, for he hath not taken away his mercy from thehouse of Israel, but hath destroyed our enemies by mine handsthis night.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	15	So she took the head out of the bag, and shewed it, and saidunto them, behold the head of Holofernes, the chief captain ofthe army of Assur, and behold the canopy, wherein he did lie inhis drunkenness; and the Lord hath smitten him by the hand of awoman.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	16	As the Lord liveth, who hath kept me in my way that I went,my countenance hath deceived him to his destruction, and yethath he not committed sin with me, to defile and shame me.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	17	Then all the people were wonderfully astonished, and bowedthemselves and worshipped God, and said with one accord, Blessedbe thou, O our God, which hast this day brought to nought theenemies of thy people.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	18	Then said Ozias unto her, O daughter, blessed art thou of themost high God above all the women upon the earth; and blessed bethe Lord God, which hath created the heavens and the earth,which hath directed thee to the cutting off of the head of thechief of our enemies.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	19	For this thy confidence shall not depart from the heart ofmen, which remember the power of God for ever.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	13	20	And God turn these things to thee for a perpetual praise, tovisit thee in good things because thou hast not spared thy lifefor the affliction of our nation, but hast revenged our ruin,walking a straight way before our God. And all the people said;So be it, so be it.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	1	Then said Judith unto them, Hear me now, my brethren, andtake this head, and hang it upon the highest place of yourwalls.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	2	And so soon as the morning shall appear, and the sun shallcome forth upon the earth, take ye every one his weapons, and goforth every valiant man out of the city, and set ye a captainover them, as though ye would go down into the field toward thewatch of the Assyrians; but go not down.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	3	Then they shall take their armour, and shall go into theircamp, and raise up the captains of the army of Assur, and shallrun to the tent of Holofernes, but shall not find him: then fearshall fall upon them, and they shall flee before your face.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	4	So ye, and all that inhabit the coast of Israel, shall pursuethem, and overthrow them as they go.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	5	But before ye do these things, call me Achior the Ammonite,that he may see and know him that despised the house of Israel,and that sent him to us as it were to his death.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	6	Then they called Achior out of the house of Ozias; and whenhe was come, and saw the head of Holofernes in a man's hand inthe assembly of the people, he fell down on his face, and hisspirit failed.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	7	But when they had recovered him, he fell at Judith's feet,and reverenced her, and said, Blessed art thou in all thetabernacles of Juda, and in all nations, which hearing thy nameshall be astonished.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	8	Now therefore tell me all the things that thou hast done inthese days. Then Judith declared unto him in the midst of thepeople all that she had done, from the day that she went forthuntil that hour she spake unto them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	9	And when she had left off speaking, the people shouted with aloud voice, and made a joyful noise in their city.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	10	And when Achior had seen all that the God of Israel had done,he believed in God greatly, and circumcised the flesh of hisforeskin, and was joined unto the house of Israel unto this day.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	11	And as soon as the morning arose, they hanged the head ofHolofernes upon the wall, and every man took his weapons, andthey went forth by bands unto the straits of the mountain.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	12	But when the Assyrians saw them, they sent to their leaders,which came to their captains and tribunes, and to every one oftheir rulers.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	13	So they came to Holofernes' tent, and said to him that hadthe charge of all his things, Waken now our lord: for the slaveshave been bold to come down against us to battle, that they maybe utterly destroyed.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	14	Then went in Bagoas, and knocked at the door of the tent; forhe thought that he had slept with Judith.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	15	But because none answered, he opened it, and went into thebedchamber, and found him cast upon the floor dead, and his headwas taken from him.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	16	Therefore he cried with a loud voice, with weeping, andsighing, and a mighty cry, and rent his garments.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	17	After he went into the tent where Judith lodged: and when hefound her not, he leaped out to the people, and cried,
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	18	These slaves have dealt treacherously; one woman of theHebrews hath brought shame upon the house of kingNabuchodonosor: for, behold, Holofernes lieth upon the groundwithout a head.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	14	19	When the captains of the Assyrians' army heard these words,they rent their coats and their minds were wonderfully troubled,and there was a cry and a very great noise throughout the camp.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	1	And when they that were in the tents heard, they wereastonished at the thing that was done.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	2	And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was noman that durst abide in the sight of his neighbour, but rushingout all together, they fled into every way of the plain, and ofthe hill country.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	3	They also that had camped in the mountains round aboutBethulia fled away. Then the children of Israel, every one thatwas a warrior among them, rushed out upon them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	4	Then sent Ozias to Betomasthem, and to Bebai, and Chobai, andCola and to all the coasts of Israel, such as should tell thethings that were done, and that all should rush forth upon theirenemies to destroy them.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	5	Now when the children of Israel heard it, they all fell uponthem with one consent, and slew them unto Chobai: likewise alsothey that came from Jerusalem, and from all the hill country,(for men had told them what things were done in the camp oftheir enemies) and they that were in Galaad, and in Galilee,chased them with a great slaughter, until they were pastDamascus and the borders thereof.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	6	And the residue that dwelt at Bethulia, fell upon the camp ofAssur, and spoiled them, and were greatly enriched.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	7	And the children of Israel that returned from the slaughterhad that which remained; and the villages and the cities, thatwere in the mountains and in the plain, gat many spoils: for themultitude was very great.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	8	Then Joacim the high priest, and the ancients of the childrenof Israel that dwelt in Jerusalem, came to behold the goodthings that God had shewed to Israel, and to see Judith, and tosalute her.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	9	And when they came unto her, they blessed her with oneaccord, and said unto her, Thou art the exaltation of Jerusalem,thou art the great glory of Israel, thou art the great rejoicingof our nation:
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	10	Thou hast done all these things by thine hand: thou hast donemuch good to Israel, and God is pleased therewith: blessed bethou of the Almighty Lord for evermore. And all the people said,So be it.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	11	And the people spoiled the camp the space of thirty days: andthey gave unto Judith Holofernes his tent, and all his plate,and beds, and vessels, and all his stuff: and she took it andlaid it on her mule; and made ready her carts, and laid themthereon.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	12	Then all the women of Israel ran together to see her, andblessed her, and made a dance among them for her: and she tookbranches in her hand, and gave also to the women that were withher.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	15	13	And they put a garland of olive upon her and her maid thatwas with her, and she went before all the people in the dance,leading all the women: and all the men of Israel followed intheir armour with garlands, and with songs in their mouths.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	1	Then Judith began to sing this thanksgiving in all Israel,and all the people sang after her this song of praise.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	2	And Judith said, Begin unto my God with timbrels, sing untomy Lord with cymbals: tune unto him a new psalm: exalt him, andcall upon his name.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	3	For God breaketh the battles: for among the camps in themidst of the people he hath delivered me out of the hands ofthem that persecuted me.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	4	Assur came out of the mountains from the north, he came withten thousands of his army, the multitude whereof stopped thetorrents, and their horsemen have covered the hills.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	5	He bragged that he would burn up my borders, and kill myyoung men with the sword, and dash the sucking children againstthe ground, and make mine infants as a prey, and my virgins as aspoil.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	6	But the Almighty Lord hath disappointed them by the hand of awoman.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	7	For the mighty one did not fall by the young men, neither didthe sons of the Titans smite him, nor high giants set upon him:but Judith the daughter of Merari weakened him with the beautyof her countenance.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	8	For she put off the garment of her widowhood for theexaltation of those that were oppressed in Israel, and anointedher face with ointment, and bound her hair in a tire, and took alinen garment to deceive him.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	9	Her sandals ravished his eyes, her beauty took his mindprisoner, and the fauchion passed through his neck.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	10	The Persians quaked at her boldness, and the Medes weredaunted at her hardiness.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	11	Then my afflicted shouted for joy, and my weak ones criedaloud; but they were astonished: these lifted up their voices,but they were overthrown.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	12	The sons of the damsels have pierced them through, andwounded them as fugatives' children: they perished by the battleof the Lord.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	13	I will sing unto the Lord a new song: O Lord, thou art greatand glorious, wonderful in strength, and invincible.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	14	Let all creatures serve thee: for thou spakest, and they weremade, thou didst send forth thy spirit, and it created them, andthere is none that can resist thy voice.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	15	For the mountains shall be moved from their foundations withthe waters, the rocks shall melt as wax at thy presence: yetthou art merciful to them that fear thee.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	16	For all sacrifice is too little for a sweet savour unto thee,and all the fat is not sufficient for thy burnt offering: but hethat feareth the Lord is great at all times.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	17	Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the LordAlmighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, inputting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them,and weep for ever.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	18	Now as soon as they entered into Jerusalem, they worshippedthe Lord; and as soon as the people were purified, they offeredtheir burnt offerings, and their free offerings, and theirgifts.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	19	Judith also dedicated all the stuff of Holofernes, which thepeople had given her, and gave the canopy, which she had takenout of his bedchamber, for a gift unto the Lord.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	20	So the people continued feasting in Jerusalem before thesanctuary for the space of three months and Judith remained withthem.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	21	After this time every one returned to his own inheritance,and Judith went to Bethulia, and remained in her own possession,and was in her time honourable in all the country.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	22	And many desired her, but none knew her all the days of herlife, after that Manasses her husband was dead, and was gatheredto his people.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	23	But she increased more and more in honour, and waxed old inher husband's house, being an hundred and five years old, andmade her maid free; so she died in Bethulia: and they buried herin the cave of her husband Manasses.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	24	And the house of Israel lamented her seven days: and beforeshe died, she did distribute her goods to all them that werenearest of kindred to Manasses her husband, and to them thatwere the nearest of her kindred.
The Book of Judith	Jdt	16	25	And there was none that made the children of Israel any moreafraid in the days of Judith, nor a long time after her death.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	1	Love righteousness, ye that be judges of the earth: think ofthe Lord with a good (heart,) and in simplicity of heart seekhim.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	2	For he will be found of them that tempt him not; and shewethhimself unto such as do not distrust him.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	3	For froward thoughts separate from God: and his power, whenit is tried, reproveth the unwise.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	4	For into a malicious soul wisdom shall not enter; nor dwellin the body that is subject unto sin.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	5	For the holy spirit of discipline will flee deceit, andremove from thoughts that are without understanding, and willnot abide when unrighteousness cometh in.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	6	For wisdom is a loving spirit; and will not acquit ablasphemer of his words: for God is witness of his reins, and atrue beholder of his heart, and a hearer of his tongue.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	7	For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world: and that whichcontaineth all things hath knowledge of the voice.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	8	Therefore he that speaketh unrighteous things cannot be hid:neither shall vengeance, when it punisheth, pass by him.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	9	For inquisition shall be made into the counsels of theungodly: and the sound of his words shall come unto the Lord forthe manifestation of his wicked deeds.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	10	For the ear of jealousy heareth all things: and the noise ofmurmurings is not hid.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	11	Therefore beware of murmuring, which is unprofitable; andrefrain your tongue from backbiting: for there is no word sosecret, that shall go for nought: and the mouth that beliethslayeth the soul.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	12	Seek not death in the error of your life: and pull not uponyourselves destruction with the works of your hands.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	13	For God made not death: neither hath he pleasure in thedestruction of the living.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	14	For he created all things, that they might have their being:and the generations of the world were healthful; and there is nopoison of destruction in them, nor the kingdom of death upon theearth:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	15	(For righteousness is immortal:)
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	1	16	But ungodly men with their works and words called it to them:for when they thought to have it their friend, they consumed tonought, and made a covenant with it, because they are worthy totake part with it.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	1	For the ungodly said, reasoning with themselves, but notaright, Our life is short and tedious, and in the death of a manthere is no remedy: neither was there any man known to havereturned from the grave.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	2	For we are born at all adventure: and we shall be hereafteras though we had never been: for the breath in our nostrils isas smoke, and a little spark in the moving of our heart:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	3	Which being extinguished, our body shall be turned intoashes, and our spirit shall vanish as the soft air,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	4	And our name shall be forgotten in time, and no man shallhave our works in remembrance, and our life shall pass away asthe trace of a cloud, and shall be dispersed as a mist, that isdriven away with the beams of the sun, and overcome with theheat thereof.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	5	For our time is a very shadow that passeth away; and afterour end there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that noman cometh again.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	6	Come on therefore, let us enjoy the good things that arepresent: and let us speedily use the creatures like as in youth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	7	Let us fill ourselves with costly wine and ointments: and letno flower of the spring pass by us:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	8	Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds, before they bewithered:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	9	Let none of us go without his part of our voluptuousness: letus leave tokens of our joyfulness in every place: for this isour portion, and our lot is this.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	10	Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare thewidow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	11	Let our strength be the law of justice: for that which isfeeble is found to be nothing worth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	12	Therefore let us lie in wait for the righteous; because he isnot for our turn, and he is clean contrary to our doings: heupbraideth us with our offending the law, and objecteth to ourinfamy the transgressings of our education.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	13	He professeth to have the knowledge of God: and he callethhimself the child of the Lord.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	14	He was made to reprove our thoughts.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	15	He is grievous unto us even to behold: for his life is notlike other men's, his ways are of another fashion.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	16	We are esteemed of him as counterfeits: he abstaineth fromour ways as from filthiness: he pronounceth the end of the justto be blessed, and maketh his boast that God is his father.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	17	Let us see if his words be true: and let us prove what shallhappen in the end of him.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	18	For if the just man be the son of God, he will help him, anddeliver him from the hand of his enemies.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	19	Let us examine him with despitefulness and torture, that wemay know his meekness, and prove his patience.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	20	Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his ownsaying he shall be respected.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	21	Such things they did imagine, and were deceived: for theirown wickedness hath blinded them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	22	As for the mysteries of God, they kn ew them not: neitherhoped they for the wages of righteousness, nor discerned areward for blameless souls.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	23	For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be animage of his own eternity.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	2	24	Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into theworld: and they that do hold of his side do find it.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	1	But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, andthere shall no torment touch them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	2	In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and theirdeparture is taken for misery,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	3	And their going from us to be utter destruction: but they arein peace.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	4	For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is theirhope full of immortality.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	5	And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatlyrewarded: for God proved them, and found them worthy forhimself.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	6	As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and received themas a burnt offering.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	7	And in the time of their visitation they shall shine, and runto and fro like sparks among the stubble.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	8	They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over thepeople, and their Lord shall reign for ever.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	9	They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth:and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for graceand mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	10	But the ungodly shall be punished according to their ownimaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsakenthe Lord.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	11	For whoso despiseth wisdom and nurture, he is miserable, andtheir hope is vain, their labours unfruitful, and their worksunprofitable:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	12	Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	13	Their offspring is cursed. Wherefore blessed is the barrenthat is undefiled, which hath not known the sinful bed: sheshall have fruit in the visitation of souls.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	14	And blessed is the eunuch, which with his hands hath wroughtno iniquity, nor imagined wicked things against God: for untohim shall be given the special gift of faith, and an inheritancein the temple of the Lord more acceptable to his mind.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	15	For glorious is the fruit of good labours: and the root ofwisdom shall never fall away.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	16	As for the children of adulterers, they shall not come totheir perfection, and the seed of an unrighteous bed shall berooted out.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	17	For though they live long, yet shall they be nothingregarded: and their last age shall be without honour.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	18	Or, if they die quickly, they have no hope, neither comfortin the day of trial.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	3	19	For horrible is the end of the unrighteous generation.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	1	Better it is to have no children, and to have virtue: for thememorial thereof is immortal: because it is known with God, andwith men.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	2	When it is present, men take example at it; and when it isgone, they desire it: it weareth a crown, and triumpheth forever, having gotten the victory, striving for undefiled rewards.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	3	But the multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive,nor take deep rooting from bastard slips, nor lay any fastfoundation.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	4	For though they flourish in branches for a time; yet standingnot last, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through theforce of winds they shall be rooted out.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	5	The imperfect branches shall be broken off, their fruitunprofitable, not ripe to eat, yea, meet for nothing.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	6	For children begotten of unlawful beds are witnesses ofwickedness against their parents in their trial.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	7	But though the righteous be prevented with death, yet shallhe be in rest.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	8	For honourable age is not that which standeth in length oftime, nor that is measured by number of years.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	9	But wisdom is the gray hair unto men, and an unspotted lifeis old age.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	10	He pleased God, and was beloved of him: so that living amongsinners he was translated.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	11	Yea speedily was he taken away, lest that wickedness shouldalter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	12	For the bewitching of naughtiness doth obscure things thatare honest; and the wandering of concupiscence doth underminethe simple mind.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	13	He, being made perfect in a short time, fulfilled a longtime:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	14	For his soul pleased the Lord: therefore hasted he to takehim away from among the wicked.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	15	This the people saw, and understood it not, neither laid theyup this in their minds, That his grace and mercy is with hissaints, and that he hath respect unto his chosen.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	16	Thus the righteous that is dead shall condemn the ungodlywhich are living; and youth that is soon perfected the manyyears and old age of the unrighteous.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	17	For they shall see the end of the wise, and shall notunderstand what God in his counsel hath decreed of him, and towhat end the Lord hath set him in safety.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	18	They shall see him, and despise him; but God shall laugh themto scorn: and they shall hereafter be a vile carcase, and areproach among the dead for evermore.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	19	For he shall rend them, and cast them down headlong, thatthey shall be speechless; and he shall shake them from thefoundation; and they shall be utterly laid waste, and be insorrow; and their memorial shall perish.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	4	20	And when they cast up the accounts of their sins, they shallcome with fear: and their own iniquities shall convince them totheir face.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	1	Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness beforethe face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account ofhis labours.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	2	When they see it, they shall be troubled with terrible fear,and shall be amazed at the strangeness of his salvation, so farbeyond all that they looked for.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	3	And they repenting and groaning for anguish of spirit shallsay within themselves, This was he, whom we had sometimes inderision, and a proverb of reproach:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	4	We fools accounted his life madness, and his end to bewithout honour:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	5	How is he numbered among the children of God, and his lot isamong the saints!
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	6	Therefore have we erred from the way of truth, and the lightof righteousness hath not shined unto us, and the sun ofrighteousness rose not upon us.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	7	We wearied ourselves in the way of wickedness anddestruction: yea, we have gone through deserts, where there layno way: but as for the way of the Lord, we have not known it.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	8	What hath pride profited us? or what good hath riches withour vaunting brought us?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	9	All those things are passed away like a shadow, and as a postthat hasted by;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	10	And as a ship that passeth over the waves of the water, whichwhen it is gone by, the trace thereof cannot be found, neitherthe pathway of the keel in the waves;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	11	Or as when a bird hath flown through the air, there is notoken of her way to be found, but the light air being beatenwith the stroke of her wings and parted with the violent noiseand motion of them, is passed through, and therein afterwards nosign where she went is to be found;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	12	Or like as when an arrow is shot at a mark, it parteth theair, which immediately cometh together again, so that a mancannot know where it went through:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	13	Even so we in like manner, as soon as we were born, began todraw to our end, and had no sign of virtue to shew; but wereconsumed in our own wickedness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	14	For the hope of the Godly is like dust that is blown awaywith the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with thestorm; like as the smoke which is dispersed here and there witha tempest, and passeth away as the remembrance of a guest thattarrieth but a day.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	15	But the righteous live for evermore; their reward also iswith the Lord, and the care of them is with the most High.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	16	Therefore shall they receive a glorious kingdom, and abeautiful crown from the Lord's hand: for with his right handshall he cover them, and with his arm shall he protect them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	17	He shall take to him his jealousy for complete armour, andmake the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	18	He shall put on righteousness as a breastplate, and truejudgment instead of an helmet.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	19	He shall take holiness for an invincible shield.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	20	His severe wrath shall he sharpen for a sword, and the worldshall fight with him against the unwise.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	21	Then shall the right aiming thunderbolts go abroad; and fromthe clouds, as from a well drawn bow, shall they fly to themark.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	22	And hailstones full of wrath shall be cast as out of a stonebow, and the water of the sea shall rage against them, and thefloods shall cruelly drown them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	5	23	Yea, a mighty wind shall stand up against them, and like astorm shall blow them away: thus iniquity shall lay waste thewhole earth, and ill dealing shall overthrow the thrones of themighty.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	1	Hear therefore, O ye kings, and understand; learn, ye that bejudges of the ends of the earth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	2	Give ear, ye that rule the people, and glory in the multitudeof nations.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	3	For power is given you of the Lord, and sovereignty from theHighest, who shall try your works, and search out your counsels.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	4	Because, being ministers of his kingdom, ye have not judgedaright, nor kept the law, nor walked after the counsel of God;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	5	Horribly and speedily shall he come upon you: for a sharpjudgment shall be to them that be in high places.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	6	For mercy will soon pardon the meanest: but mighty men shallbe mightily tormented.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	7	For he which is Lord over all shall fear no man's person,neither shall he stand in awe of any man's greatness: for hehath made the small and great, and careth for all alike.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	8	But a sore trial shall come upon the mighty.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	9	Unto you therefore, O kings, do I speak, that ye may learnwisdom, and not fall away.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	10	For they that keep holiness holily shall be judged holy: andthey that have learned such things shall find what to answer.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	11	Wherefore set your affection upon my words; desire them, andye shall be instructed.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	12	Wisdom is glorious, and never fadeth away: yea, she is easilyseen of them that love her, and found of such as seek her.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	13	She preventeth them that desire her, in making herself firstknown unto them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	14	Whoso seeketh her early shall have no great travail: for heshall find her sitting at his doors.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	15	To think therefore upon her is perfection of wisdom: andwhoso watcheth for her shall quickly be without care.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	16	For she goeth about seeking such as are worthy of her,sheweth herself favourably unto them in the ways, and meeteththem in every thought.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	17	For the very true beginning of her is the desire ofdiscipline; and the care of discipline is love;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	18	And love is the keeping of her laws; and the giving heed untoher laws is the assurance of incorruption;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	19	And incorruption maketh us near unto God:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	20	Therefore the desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	21	If your delight be then in thrones and sceptres, O ye kingsof the people, honour wisdom, that ye may reign for evermore.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	22	As for wisdom, what she is, and how she came up, I will tellyou, and will not hide mysteries from you: but will seek her outfrom the beginning of her nativity, and bring the knowledge ofher into light, and will not pass over the truth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	23	Neither will I go with consuming envy; for such a man shallhave no fellowship with wisdom.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	24	But the multitude of the wise is the welfare of the world:and a wise king is the upholding of the people.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	6	25	Receive therefore instruction through my words, and it shalldo you good.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	1	I myself also am a mortal man, like to all, and the offspringof him that was first made of the earth,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	2	And in my mother's womb was fashioned to be flesh in the timeof ten months, being compacted in blood, of the seed of man, andthe pleasure that came with sleep.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	3	And when I was born, I drew in the common air, and fell uponthe earth, which is of like nature, and the first voice which Iuttered was crying, as all others do.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	4	I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and that with cares.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	5	For there is no king that had any other beginning of birth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	6	For all men have one entrance into life, and the like goingout.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	7	Wherefore I prayed, and understanding was given me: I calledupon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	8	I preferred her before sceptres and thrones, and esteemedriches nothing in comparison of her.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	9	Neither compared I unto her any precious stone, because allgold in respect of her is as a little sand, and silver shall becounted as clay before her.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	10	I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have herinstead of light: for the light that cometh from her never goethout.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	11	All good things together came to me with her, and innumerableriches in her hands.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	12	And I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom goeth before them:and I knew not that she was the mother of them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	13	I learned diligently, and do communicate her liberally: I donot hide her riches.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	14	For she is a treasure unto men that never faileth: which theythat use become the friends of God, being commended for thegifts that come from learning.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	15	God hath granted me to speak as I would, and to conceive asis meet for the things that are given me: because it is he thatleadeth unto wisdom, and directeth the wise.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	16	For in his hand are both we and our words; all wisdom also,and knowledge of workmanship.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	17	For he hath given me certain knowledge of the things thatare, namely, to know how the world was made, and the operationof the elements:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	18	The beginning, ending, and midst of the times: thealterations of the turning of the sun, and the change ofseasons:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	19	The circuits of years, and the positions of stars:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	20	The natures of living creatures, and the furies of wildbeasts: the violence of winds, and the reasonings of men: thediversities of plants and the virtues of roots:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	21	And all such things as are either secret or manifest, them Iknow.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	22	For wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me: forin her is an understanding spirit holy, one only, manifold,subtil, lively, clear, undefiled, plain, not subject to hurt,loving the thing that is good quick, which cannot be letted,ready to do good,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	23	Kind to man, steadfast, sure, free from care, having allpower, overseeing all things, and going through allunderstanding, pure, and most subtil, spirits.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	24	For wisdom is more moving than any motion: she passeth andgoeth through all things by reason of her pureness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	25	For she is the breath of the power of God, and a pureinfluence flowing from the glory of the Almighty: therefore canno defiled thing fall into her.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	26	For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, theunspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of hisgoodness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	27	And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining inherself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages enteringinto holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	28	For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	29	For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all theorder of stars: being compared with the light, she is foundbefore it.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	7	30	For after this cometh night: but vice shall not prevailagainst wisdom.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	1	Wisdom reacheth from one end to another mightily: and sweetlydoth she order all things.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	2	I loved her, and sought her out from my youth, I desired tomake her my spouse, and I was a lover of her beauty.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	3	In that she is conversant with God, she magnifieth hernobility: yea, the Lord of all things himself loved her.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	4	For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God,and a lover of his works.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	5	If riches be a possession to be desired in this life; what isricher than wisdom, that worketh all things?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	6	And if prudence work; who of all that are is a more cunningworkman than she?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	7	And if a man love righteousness her labours are virtues: forshe teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude:which are such things, as en can have nothing more profitable intheir life.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	8	If a man desire much experience, she knoweth things of old,and conjectureth aright what is to come: she knoweth thesubtilties of speeches, and can expound dark sentences: sheforeseeth signs and wonders, and the events of seasons andtimes.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	9	Therefore I purposed to take her to me to live with me,knowing that she would be a counsellor of good things, and acomfort in cares and grief.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	10	For her sake I shall have estimation among the multitude, andhonour with the elders, though I be young.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	11	I shall be found of a quick conceit in judgment, and shall beadmired in the sight of great men.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	12	When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when Ispeak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, theyshall lay their hands upon their mouth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	13	Moreover by the means of her I shall obtain immortality, andleave behind me an everlasting memorial to them that come afterme.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	14	I shall set the people in order, and the nations shall besubject unto me.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	15	Horrible tyrants shall be afraid, when they do but hear ofme; I shall be found good among the multitude, and valiant inwar.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	16	After I am come into mine house, I will repose myself withher: for her conversation hath no bitterness; and to live withher hath no sorrow, but mirth and joy.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	17	Now when I considered these things in myself, and ponderedthem in my heart, how that to be allied unto wisdom isimmortality;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	18	And great pleasure it is to have her friendship; and in theworks of her hands are infinite riches; and in the exercise ofconference with her, prudence; and in talking with her, a goodreport; I went about seeking how to take her to me.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	19	For I was a witty child, and had a good spirit.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	20	Yea rather, being good, I came into a body undefiled.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	8	21	Nevertheless, when I perceived that I could not otherwiseobtain her, except God gave her me; and that was a point ofwisdom also to know whose gift she was; I prayed unto the Lord,and besought him, and with my whole heart I said,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	1	O God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, who hast made allthings with thy word,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	2	And ordained man through thy wisdom, that he should havedominion over the creatures which thou hast made,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	3	And order the world according to equity and righteousness,and execute judgment with an upright heart:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	4	Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne; and reject me notfrom among thy children:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	5	For I thy servant and son of thine handmaid am a feebleperson, and of a short time, and too young for the understandingof judgment and laws.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	6	For though a man be never so perfect among the children ofmen, yet if thy wisdom be not with him, he shall be nothingregarded.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	7	Thou hast chosen me to be a king of thy people, and a judgeof thy sons and daughters:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	8	Thou hast commanded me to build a temple upon thy holy mount,and an altar in the city wherein thou dwellest, a resemblance ofthe holy tabernacle, which thou hast prepared from thebeginning.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	9	And wisdom was with thee: which knoweth thy works, and waspresent when thou madest the world, and knew what was acceptablein thy sight, and right in thy commandments.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	10	O send her out of thy holy heavens, and from the throne ofthy glory, that being present she may labour with me, that I mayknow what is pleasing unto thee.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	11	For she knoweth and understandeth all things, and she shalllead me soberly in my doings, and preserve me in her power.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	12	So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I judge thypeople righteously, and be worthy to sit in my father's seat.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	13	For what man is he that can know the counsel of God? or whocan think what the will of the Lord is?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	14	For the thoughts of mortal men are miserable, and our devicesare but uncertain.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	15	For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and theearthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon manythings.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	16	And hardly do we guess aright at things that are upon earth,and with labour do we find the things that are before us: butthe things that are in heaven who hath searched out?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	17	And thy counsel who hath known, except thou give wisdom, andsend thy Holy Spirit from above?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	9	18	For so the ways of them which lived on the earth werereformed, and men were taught the things that are pleasing untothee, and were saved through wisdom.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	1	She preserved the first formed father of the world, that wascreated alone, and brought him out of his fall,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	2	And gave him power to rule all things.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	3	But when the unrighteous went away from her in his anger, heperished also in the fury wherewith he murdered his brother.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	4	For whose cause the earth being drowned with the flood,wisdom again preserved it, and directed the course of therighteous in a piece of wood of small value.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	5	Moreover, the nations in their wicked conspiracy beingconfounded, she found out the righteous, and preserved himblameless unto God, and kept him strong against his tendercompassion toward his son.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	6	When the ungodly perished, she delivered the righteous man,who fled from the fire which fell down upon the five cities.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	7	Of whose wickedness even to this day the waste land thatsmoketh is a testimony, and plants bearing fruit that never cometo ripeness: and a standing pillar of salt is a monument of anunbelieving soul.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	8	For regarding not wisdom, they gat not only this hurt, thatthey knew not the things which were good; but also left behindthem to the world a memorial of their foolishness: so that inthe things wherein they offended they could not so much as behid.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	9	Rut wisdom delivered from pain those that attended upon her.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	10	When the righteous fled from his brother's wrath she guidedhim in right paths, shewed him the kingdom of God, and gave himknowledge of holy things, made him rich in his travels, andmultiplied the fruit of his labours.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	11	In the covetousness of such as oppressed him she stood byhim, and made him rich.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	12	She defended him from his enemies, and kept him safe fromthose that lay in wait, and in a sore conflict she gave him thevictory; that he might know that goodness is stronger than all.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	13	When the righteous was sold, she forsook him not, butdelivered him from sin: she went down with him into the pit,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	14	And left him not in bonds, till she brought him the sceptreof the kingdom, and power against those that oppressed him: asfor them that had accused him, she shewed them to be liars, andgave him perpetual glory.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	15	She delivered the righteous people and blameless seed fromthe nation that oppressed them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	16	She entered into the soul of the servant of the Lord, andwithstood dreadful kings in wonders and signs;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	17	Rendered to the righteous a reward of their labours, guidedthem in a marvellous way, and was unto them for a cover by day,and a light of stars in the night season;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	18	Brought them through the Red sea, and led them through muchwater:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	19	But she drowned their enemies, and cast them up out of thebottom of the deep.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	20	Therefore the righteous spoiled the ungodly, and praised thyholy name, O Lord, and magnified with one accord thine hand,that fought for them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	10	21	For wisdom opened the mouth of the dumb, and made the tonguesof them that cannot speak eloquent.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	1	She prospered their works in the hand of the holy prophet.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	2	They went through the wilderness that was not inhabited, andpitched tents in places where there lay no way.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	3	They stood against their enemies, and were avenged of theiradversaries.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	4	When they were thirsty, they called upon thee, and water wasgiven them out of the flinty rock, and their thirst was quenchedout of the hard stone.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	5	For by what things their enemies were punished, by the samethey in their need were benefited.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	6	For instead of of a perpetual running river troubled withfoul blood,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	7	For a manifest reproof of that commandment, whereby theinfants were slain, thou gavest unto them abundance of water bya means which they hoped not for:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	8	Declaring by that thirst then how thou hadst punished theiradversaries.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	9	For when they were tried albeit but in mercy chastised, theyknew how the ungodly were judged in wrath and tormented,thirsting in another manner than the just.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	10	For these thou didst admonish and try, as a father: but theother, as a severe king, thou didst condemn and punish.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	11	Whether they were absent or present, they were vexed alike.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	12	For a double grief came upon them, and a groaning for theremembrance of things past.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	13	For when they heard by their own punishments the other to bebenefited, they had some feeling of the Lord.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	14	For whom they respected with scorn, when he was long beforethrown out at the casting forth of the infants, him in the end,when they saw what came to pass, they admired.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	15	But for the foolish devices of their wickedness, wherewithbeing deceived they worshipped serpents void of reason, and vilebeasts, thou didst send a multitude of unreasonable beasts uponthem for vengeance;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	16	That they might know, that wherewithal a man sinneth, by thesame also shall he be punished.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	17	For thy Almighty hand, that made the world of matter withoutform, wanted not means to send among them a multitude of bearsor fierce lions,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	18	Or unknown wild beasts, full of rage, newly created,breathing out either a fiery vapour, or filthy scents ofscattered smoke, or shooting horrible sparkles out of theireyes:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	19	Whereof not only the harm might dispatch them at once, butalso the terrible sight utterly destroy them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	20	Yea, and without these might they have fallen down with oneblast, being persecuted of vengeance, and scattered abroadthrough the breath of thy power: but thou hast ordered allthings in measure and number and weight.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	21	For thou canst shew thy great strength at all times when thouwilt; and who may withstand the power of thine arm?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	22	For the whole world before thee is as a little grain of thebalance, yea, as a drop of the morning dew that falleth downupon the earth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	23	But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things,and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	24	For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrestnothing which thou hast made: for never wouldest thou have madeany thing, if thou hadst hated it.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	25	And how could any thing have endured, if it had not been thywill? or been preserved, if not called by thee?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	11	26	But thou sparest all: for they are thine, O Lord, thou loverof souls.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	1	For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	2	Therefore chastenest thou them by little and little thatoffend, and warnest them by putting them in remembrance whereinthey have offended, that leaving their wickedness they maybelieve on thee, O Lord.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	3	For it was thy will to destroy by the hands of our fathersboth those old inhabitants of thy holy land,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	4	Whom thou hatedst for doing most odious works of witchcrafts,and wicked sacrifices;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	5	And also those merciless murderers of children, and devourersof man's flesh, and the feasts of blood,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	6	With their priests out of the midst of their idolatrous crew,and the parents, that killed with their own hands soulsdestitute of help:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	7	That the land, which thou esteemedst above all other, mightreceive a worthy colony of God's children.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	8	Nevertheless even those thou sparedst as men, and didst sendwasps, forerunners of thine host, to destroy them by little andlittle.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	9	Not that thou wast unable to bring the ungodly under the handof the righteous in battle, or to destroy them at once withcruel beasts, or with one rough word:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	10	But executing thy judgments upon them by little and little,thou gavest them place of repentance, not being ignorant thatthey were a naughty generation, and that their malice was bredin them, and that their cogitation would never be changed.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	11	For it was a cursed seed from the beginning; neither didstthou for fear of any man give them pardon for those thingswherein they sinned.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	12	For who shall say, What hast thou done? or who shallwithstand thy judgment? or who shall accuse thee for the nationsthat perish, whom thou made? or who shall come to stand againstthee, to be revenged for the unrighteous men?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	13	For neither is there any God but thou that careth for all, towhom thou mightest shew that thy judgment is not unright.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	14	Neither shall king or tyrant be able to set his face againstthee for any whom thou hast punished.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	15	Forsomuch then as thou art righteous thyself, thou orderestall things righteously: thinking it not agreeable with thy powerto condemn him that hath not deserved to be punished.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	16	For thy power is the beginning of righteousness, and becausethou art the Lord of all, it maketh thee to be gracious untoall.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	17	For when men will not believe that thou art of a full power,thou shewest thy strength, and among them that know it thoumakest their boldness manifest.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	18	But thou, mastering thy power, judgest with equity, andorderest us with great favour: for thou mayest use power whenthou wilt.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	19	But by such works hast thou taught thy people that the justman should be merciful, and hast made thy children to be of agood hope that thou givest repentance for sins.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	20	For if thou didst punish the enemies of thy children, and thecondemned to death, with such deliberation, giving them time andplace, whereby they might be delivered from their malice:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	21	With how great circumspection didst thou judge thine ownsons, unto whose fathers thou hast sworn, and made covenants ofgood promises?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	22	Therefore, whereas thou dost chasten us, thou scourgest ourenemies a thousand times more, to the intent that, when wejudge, we should carefully think of thy goodness, and when weourselves are judged, we should look for mercy.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	23	Wherefore, whereas men have lived dissolutely andunrighteously, thou hast tormented them with their ownabominations.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	24	For they went astray very far in the ways of error, and heldthem for gods, which even among the beasts of their enemies weredespised, being deceived, as children of no understanding.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	25	Therefore unto them, as to children without the use ofreason, thou didst send a judgment to mock them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	26	But they that would not be reformed by that correction,wherein he dallied with them, shall feel a judgment worthy ofGod.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	12	27	For, look, for what things they grudged, when they werepunished, that is, for them whom they thought to be gods; [now]being punished in them, when they saw it, they acknowledged himto be the true God, whom before they denied to know: andtherefore came extreme damnation upon them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	1	Surely vain are all men by nature, who are ignorant of God,and could not out of the good things that are seen know him thatis: neither by considering the works did they acknowledge theworkmaster;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	2	But deemed either fire, or wind, or the swift air, or thecircle of the stars, or the violent water, or the lights ofheaven, to be the gods which govern the world.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	3	With whose beauty if they being delighted took them to begods; let them know how much better the Lord of them is: for thefirst author of beauty hath created them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	4	But if they were astonished at their power and virtue, letthem understand by them, how much mightier he is that made them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	5	For by the greatness and beauty of the creaturesproportionably the maker of them is seen.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	6	But yet for this they are the less to be blamed: for theyperadventure err, seeking God, and desirous to find him.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	7	For being conversant in his works they search him diligently,and believe their sight: because the things are beautiful thatare seen.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	8	Howbeit neither are they to be pardoned.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	9	For if they were able to know so much, that they could aim atthe world; how did they not sooner find out the Lord thereof?
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	10	But miserable are they, and in dead things is their hope, whocall them gods, which are the works of men's hands, gold andsilver, to shew art in, and resemblances of beasts, or a stonegood for nothing, the work of an ancient hand.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	11	Now a carpenter that felleth timber, after he hath sawn downa tree meet for the purpose, and taken off all the barkskilfully round about, and hath wrought it handsomely, and madea vessel thereof fit for the service of man's life;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	12	And after spending the refuse of his work to dress his meat,hath filled himself;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	13	And taking the very refuse among those which served to nouse, being a crooked piece of wood, and full of knots, hathcarved it diligently, when he had nothing else to do, and formedit by the skill of his understanding, and fashioned it to theimage of a man;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	14	Or made it like some vile beast, laying it over withvermilion, and with paint colouring it red, and covering everyspot therein;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	15	And when he had made a convenient room for it, set it in awall, and made it fast with iron:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	16	For he provided for it that it might not fall, knowing thatit was unable to help itself; for it is an image, and hath needof help:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	17	Then maketh he prayer for his goods, for his wife andchildren, and is not ashamed to speak to that which hath nolife.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	18	For health he calleth upon that which is weak: for lifeprayeth to that which is dead; for aid humbly beseecheth thatwhich hath least means to help: and for a good journey he askethof that which cannot set a foot forward:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	13	19	And for gaining and getting, and for good success of hishands, asketh ability to do of him, that is most unable to doany thing.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	1	Again, one preparing himself to sail, and about to passthrough the raging waves, calleth upon a piece of wood morerotten than the vessel that carrieth him.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	2	For verily desire of gain devised that, and the workman builtit by his skill.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	3	But thy providence, O Father, governeth it: for thou hastmade a way in the sea, and a safe path in the waves;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	4	Shewing that thou canst save from all danger: yea, though aman went to sea without art.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	5	Nevertheless thou wouldest not that the works of thy wisdomshould be idle, and therefore do men commit their lives to asmall piece of wood, and passing the rough sea in a weak vesselare saved.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	6	For in the old time also, when the proud giants perished, thehope of the world governed by thy hand escaped in a weak vessel,and left to all ages a seed of generation.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	7	For blessed is the wood whereby righteousness cometh.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	8	But that which is made with hands is cursed, as well it, ashe that made it: he, because he made it; and it, because, beingcorruptible, it was called god.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	9	For the ungodly and his ungodliness are both alike hatefulunto God.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	10	For that which is made shall be punished together with himthat made it.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	11	Therefore even upon the idols of the Gentiles shall there bea visitation: because in the creature of God they are become anabomination, and stumblingblocks to the souls of men, and asnare to the feet of the unwise.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	12	For the devising of idols was the beginning of spiritualfornication, and the invention of them the corruption of life.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	13	For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall theybe for ever.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	14	For by the vain glory of men they entered into the world, andtherefore shall they come shortly to an end.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	15	For a father afflicted with untimely mourning, when he hathmade an image of his child soon taken away, now honoured him asa god, which was then a dead man, and delivered to those thatwere under him ceremonies and sacrifices.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	16	Thus in process of time an ungodly custom grown strong waskept as a law, and graven images were worshipped by thecommandments of kings.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	17	Whom men could not honour in presence, because they dwelt faroff, they took the counterfeit of his visage from far, and madean express image of a king whom they honoured, to the end thatby this their forwardness they might flatter him that wasabsent, as if he were present.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	18	Also the singular diligence of the artificer did help to setforward the ignorant to more superstition.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	19	For he, peradventure willing to please one in authority,forced all his skill to make the resemblance of the bestfashion.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	20	And so the multitude, allured by the grace of the work, tookhim now for a god, which a little before was but honoured.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	21	And this was an occasion to deceive the world: for men,serving either calamity or tyranny, did ascribe unto stones andstocks the incommunicable name.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	22	Moreover this was not enough for them, that they erred in theknowledge of God; but whereas they lived in the great war ofignorance, those so great plagues called they peace.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	23	For whilst they slew their children in sacrifices, or usedsecret ceremonies, or made revellings of strange rites;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	24	They kept neither lives nor marriages any longer undefiled:but either one slew another traiterously, or grieved him byadultery.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	25	So that there reigned in all men without exception blood,manslaughter, theft, and dissimulation, corruption,unfaithfulness, tumults, perjury,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	26	Disquieting of good men, forgetfulness of good turns,defiling of souls, changing of kind, disorder in marriages,adultery, and shameless uncleanness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	27	For the worshipping of idols not to be named is thebeginning, the cause, and the end, of all evil.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	28	For either they are mad when they be merry, or prophesy lies,or live unjustly, or else lightly forswear themselves.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	29	For insomuch as their trust is in idols, which have no life;though they swear falsely, yet they look not to be hurt.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	30	Howbeit for both causes shall they be justly punished: bothbecause they thought not well of God, giving heed unto idols,and also unjustly swore in deceit, despising holiness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	14	31	For it is not the power of them by whom they swear: but it isthe just vengeance of sinners, that punisheth always the offenceof the ungodly.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	1	But thou, O God, art gracious and true, longsuffering, and inmercy ordering all things,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	2	For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power: but we willnot sin, knowing that we are counted thine.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	3	For to know thee is perfect righteousness: yea, to know thypower is the root of immortality.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	4	For neither did the mischievous invention of men deceive us,nor an image spotted with divers colours, the painter'sfruitless labour;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	5	The sight whereof enticeth fools to lust after it, and sothey desire the form of a dead image, that hath no breath.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	6	Both they that make them, they that desire them, and theythat worship them, are lovers of evil things, and are worthy tohave such things to trust upon.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	7	For the potter, tempering soft earth, fashioneth every vesselwith much labour for our service: yea, of the same clay hemaketh both the vessels that serve for clean uses, and likewisealso all such as serve to the contrary: but what is the use ofeither sort, the potter himself is the judge.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	8	And employing his labours lewdly, he maketh a vain god of thesame clay, even he which a little before was made of earthhimself, and within a little while after returneth to the same,out when his life which was lent him shall be demanded.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	9	Notwithstanding his care is, not that he shall have muchlabour, nor that his life is short: but striveth to excelgoldsmiths and silversmiths, and endeavoureth to do like theworkers in brass, and counteth it his glory to make counterfeitthings.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	10	His heart is ashes, his hope is more vile than earth, and hislife of less value than clay:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	11	Forasmuch as he knew not his Maker, and him that inspiredinto him an active soul, and breathed in a living spirit.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	12	But they counted our life a pastime, and our time here amarket for gain: for, say they, we must be getting every way,though it be by evil means.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	13	For this man, that of earthly matter maketh brittle vesselsand graven images, knoweth himself to offend above all others.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	14	And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them insubjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than verybabes.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	15	For they counted all the idols of the heathen to be gods:which neither have the use of eyes to see, nor noses to drawbreath, nor ears to hear, nor fingers of hands to handle; and asfor their feet, they are slow to go.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	16	For man made them, and he that borrowed his own spiritfashioned them: but no man can make a god like unto himself.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	17	For being mortal, he worketh a dead thing with wicked hands:for he himself is better than the things which he worshippeth:whereas he lived once, but they never.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	18	Yea, they worshipped those beasts also that are most hateful:for being compared together, some are worse than others.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	15	19	Neither are they beautiful, so much as to be desired inrespect of beasts: but they went without the praise of God andhis blessing.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	1	Therefore by the like were they punished worthily, and by themultitude of beasts tormented.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	2	Instead of which punishment, dealing graciously with thineown people, thou preparedst for them meat of a strange taste,even quails to stir up their appetite:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	3	To the end that they, desiring food, might for the ugly sightof the beasts sent among them lothe even that, which they mustneeds desire; but these, suffering penury for a short space,might be made partakers of a strange taste.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	4	For it was requisite, that upon them exercising tyrannyshould come penury, which they could not avoid: but to these itshould only be shewed how their enemies were tormented.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	5	For when the horrible fierceness of beasts came upon these,and they perished with the stings of crooked serpents, thy wrathendured not for ever:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	6	But they were troubled for a small season, that they might beadmonished, having a sign of salvation, to put them inremembrance of the commandment of thy law.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	7	For he that turned himself toward it was not saved by thething that he saw, but by thee, that art the Saviour of all.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	8	And in this thou madest thine enemies confess, that it isthou who deliverest from all evil:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	9	For them the bitings of grasshoppers and flies killed,neither was there found any remedy for their life: for they wereworthy to be punished by such.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	10	But thy sons not the very teeth of venomous dragons overcame:for thy mercy was ever by them, and healed them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	11	For they were pricked, that they should remember thy words;and were quickly saved, that not falling into deepforgetfulness, they might be continually mindful of thygoodness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	12	For it was neither herb, nor mollifying plaister, thatrestored them to health: but thy word, O Lord, which healeth allthings.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	13	For thou hast power of life and death: thou leadest to thegates of hell, and bringest up again.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	14	A man indeed killeth through his malice: and the spirit, whenit is gone forth, returneth not; neither the soul received upcometh again.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	15	But it is not possible to escape thine hand.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	16	For the ungodly, that denied to know thee, were scourged bythe strength of thine arm: with strange rains, hails, andshowers, were they persecuted, that they could not avoid, andthrough fire were they consumed.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	17	For, which is most to be wondered at, the fire had more forcein the water, that quencheth all things: for the world fightethfor the righteous.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	18	For sometime the flame was mitigated, that it might not burnup the beasts that were sent against the ungodly; but themselvesmight see and perceive that they were persecuted with thejudgment of God.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	19	And at another time it burneth even in the midst of waterabove the power of fire, that it might destroy the fruits of anunjust land.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	20	Instead whereof thou feddest thine own people with angels'food, and didst send them from heaven bread prepared withouttheir labour, able to content every man's delight, and agreeingto every taste.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	21	For thy sustenance declared thy sweetness unto thy children,and serving to the appetite of the eater, tempered itself toevery man's liking.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	22	But snow and ice endured the fire, and melted not, that theymight know that fire burning in the hail, and sparkling in therain, did destroy the fruits of the enemies.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	23	But this again did even forget his own strength, that therighteous might be nourished.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	24	For the creature that serveth thee, who art the Makerincreaseth his strength against the unrighteous for theirpunishment, and abateth his strength for the benefit of such asput their trust in thee.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	25	Therefore even then was it altered into all fashions, and wasobedient to thy grace, that nourisheth all things, according tothe desire of them that had need:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	26	That thy children, O Lord, whom thou lovest, might know, thatit is not the growing of fruits that nourisheth man: but that itis thy word, which preserveth them that put their trust in thee.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	27	For that which was not destroyed of the fire, being warmedwith a little sunbeam, soon melted away:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	28	That it might be known, that we must prevent the sun to givethee thanks, and at the dayspring pray unto thee.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	16	29	For the hope of the unthankful shall melt away as thewinter's hoar frost, and shall run away as unprofitable water.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	1	For great are thy judgments, and cannot be expressed:therefore unnurtured souls have erred.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	2	For when unrighteous men thought to oppress the holy nation;they being shut up in their houses, the prisoners of darkness,and fettered with the bonds of a long night, lay [there] exiledfrom the eternal providence.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	3	For while they supposed to lie hid in their secret sins, theywere scattered under a dark veil of forgetfulness, beinghorribly astonished, and troubled with [strange] apparitions.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	4	For neither might the corner that held them keep them fromfear: but noises [as of waters] falling down sounded about them,and sad visions appeared unto them with heavy countenances.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	5	No power of the fire might give them light: neither could thebright flames of the stars endure to lighten that horriblenight.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	6	Only there appeared unto them a fire kindled of itself, verydreadful: for being much terrified, they thought the thingswhich they saw to be worse than the sight they saw not.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	7	As for the illusions of art magick, they were put down, andtheir vaunting in wisdom was reproved with disgrace.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	8	For they, that promised to drive away terrors and troublesfrom a sick soul, were sick themselves of fear, worthy to belaughed at.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	9	For though no terrible thing did fear them; yet being scaredwith beasts that passed by, and hissing of serpents,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	10	They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, whichcould of no side be avoided.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	11	For wickedness, condemned by her own witness, is verytimorous, and being pressed with conscience, always forecastethgrievous things.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	12	For fear is nothing else but a betraying of the succourswhich reason offereth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	13	And the expectation from within, being less, counteth theignorance more than the cause which bringeth the torment.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	14	But they sleeping the same sleep that night, which was indeedintolerable, and which came upon them out of the bottoms ofinevitable hell,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	15	Were partly vexed with monstrous apparitions, and partlyfainted, their heart failing them: for a sudden fear, and notlooked for, came upon them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	16	So then whosoever there fell down was straitly kept, shut upin a prison without iron bars,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	17	For whether he were husbandman, or shepherd, or a labourer inthe field, he was overtaken, and endured that necessity, whichcould not be avoided: for they were all bound with one chain ofdarkness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	18	Whether it were a whistling wind, or a melodious noise ofbirds among the spreading branches, or a pleasing fall of waterrunning violently,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	19	Or a terrible sound of stones cast down, or a running thatcould not be seen of skipping beasts, or a roaring voice of mostsavage wild beasts, or a rebounding echo from the hollowmountains; these things made them to swoon for fear.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	20	For the whole world shined with clear light, and none werehindered in their labour:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	17	21	Over them only was spread an heavy night, an image of thatdarkness which should afterward receive them: but yet were theyunto themselves more grievous than the darkness.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	1	Nevertheless thy saints had a very great light, whose voicethey hearing, and not seeing their shape, because they also hadnot suffered the same things, they counted them happy.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	2	But for that they did not hurt them now, of whom they hadbeen wronged before, they thanked them, and besought them pardonfor that they had been enemies.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	3	Instead whereof thou gavest them a burning pillar of fire,both to be a guide of the unknown journey, and an harmless sunto entertain them honourably.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	4	For they were worthy to be deprived of light and imprisonedin darkness, who had kept thy sons shut up, by whom theuncorrupt light of the law was to be given unto the world.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	5	And when they had determined to slay the babes of the saints,one child being cast forth, and saved, to reprove them, thoutookest away the multitude of their children, and destroyedstthem altogether in a mighty water.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	6	Of that night were our fathers certified afore, thatassuredly knowing unto what oaths they had given credence, theymight afterwards be of good cheer.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	7	So of thy people was accepted both the salvation of therighteous, and destruction of the enemies.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	8	For wherewith thou didst punish our adversaries, by the samethou didst glorify us, whom thou hadst called.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	9	For the righteous children of good men did sacrificesecretly, and with one consent made a holy law, that the saintsshould be like partakers of the same good and evil, the fathersnow singing out the songs of praise.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	10	But on the other side there sounded an ill according cry ofthe enemies, and a lamentable noise was carried abroad forchildren that were bewailed.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	11	The master and the servant were punished after one manner;and like as the king, so suffered the common person.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	12	So they all together had innumerable dead with one kind ofdeath; neither were the living sufficient to bury them: for inone moment the noblest offspring of them was destroyed.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	13	For whereas they would not believe any thing by reason of theenchantments; upon the destruction of the firstborn, theyacknowledged this people to be the sons of God.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	14	For while all things were in quiet silence, and that nightwas in the midst of her swift course,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	15	Thine Almighty word leaped down from heaven out of thy royalthrone, as a fierce man of war into the midst of a land ofdestruction,
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	16	And brought thine unfeigned commandment as a sharp sword, andstanding up filled all things with death; and it touched theheaven, but it stood upon the earth.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	17	Then suddenly visions of horrible dreams troubled them sore,and terrors came upon them unlooked for.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	18	And one thrown here, and another there, half dead, shewed thecause of his death.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	19	For the dreams that troubled them did foreshew this, lestthey should perish, and not know why they were afflicted.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	20	Yea, the tasting of death touched the righteous also, andthere was a destruction of the multitude in the wilderness: butthe wrath endured not long.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	21	For then the blameless man made haste, and stood forth todefend them; and bringing the shield of his proper ministry,even prayer, and the propitiation of incense, set himselfagainst the wrath, and so brought the calamity to an end,declaring that he was thy servant.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	22	So he overcame the destroyer, not with strength of body, norforce of arms, but with a word subdued him that punished,alleging the oaths and covenants made with the fathers.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	23	For when the dead were now fallen down by heaps one uponanother, standing between, he stayed the wrath, and parted theway to the living.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	24	For in the long garment was the whole world, and in the fourrows of the stones was the glory of the fathers graven, and thyMajesty upon the daidem of his head.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	18	25	Unto these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them:for it was enough that they only tasted of the wrath.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	1	As for the ungodly, wrath came upon them without mercy untothe end: for he knew before what they would do;
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	2	How that having given them leave to depart, and sent themhastily away, they would repent and pursue them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	3	For whilst they were yet mourning and making lamentation atthe graves of the dead, they added another foolish device, andpursued them as fugitives, whom they had intreated to be gone.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	4	For the destiny, whereof they were worthy, drew them untothis end, and made them forget the things that had alreadyhappened, that they might fulfil the punishment which waswanting to their torments:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	5	And that thy people might pass a wonderful way: but theymight find a strange death.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	6	For the whole creature in his proper kind was fashioned againanew, serving the peculiar commandments that were given untothem, that thy children might be kept without hurt:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	7	As namely, a cloud shadowing the camp; and where water stoodbefore, dry land appeared; and out of the Red sea a way withoutimpediment; and out of the violent stream a green field:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	8	Wherethrough all the people went that were defended with thyhand, seeing thy marvellous strange wonders.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	9	For they went at large like horses, and leaped like lambs,praising thee, O Lord, who hadst delivered them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	10	For they were yet mindful of the things that were done whilethey sojourned in the strange land, how the ground brought forthflies instead of cattle, and how the river cast up a multitudeof frogs instead of fishes.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	11	But afterwards they saw a new generation of fowls, when,being led with their appetite, they asked delicate meats.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	12	For quails came up unto them from the sea for theircontentment.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	13	And punishments came upon the sinners not without formersigns by the force of thunders: for they suffered justlyaccording to their own wickedness, insomuch as they used a morehard and hateful behaviour toward strangers.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	14	For the Sodomites did not receive those, whom they knew notwhen they came: but these brought friends into bondage, that hadwell deserved of them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	15	And not only so, but peradventure some respect shall be hadof those, because they used strangers not friendly:
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	16	But these very grievously afflicted them, whom they hadreceived with feastings, and were already made partakers of thesame laws with them.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	17	Therefore even with blindness were these stricken, as thosewere at the doors of the righteous man: when, being compassedabout with horrible great darkness, every one sought the passageof his own doors.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	18	For the elements were changed in themselves by a kind ofharmony, like as in a psaltery notes change the name of thetune, and yet are always sounds; which may well be perceived bythe sight of the things that have been done.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	19	For earthly things were turned into watery, and the things,that before swam in the water, now went upon the ground.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	20	The fire had power in the water, forgetting his own virtue:and the water forgat his own quenching nature.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	21	On the other side, the flames wasted not the flesh of thecorruptible living things, though they walked therein; neithermelted they the icy kind of heavenly meat that was of nature aptto melt.
The Wisdom of Solomon	Wis	19	22	For in all things, O Lord, thou didst magnify thy people, andglorify them, neither didst thou lightly regard them: but didstassist them in every time and place.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	1	A Prologue made by an uncertain Author]	This Jesus was the son of Sirach, and grandchild toJesus of the same name with him: this man therefore lived in thelatter times, after the people had been led away captive, andcalled home a again, and almost after all the prophets. Now hisgrandfather Jesus, as he himself witnesseth, was a man of greatdiligence and wisdom among the Hebrews, who did not only gatherthe grave and short sentences of wise men, that had been beforehim, but himself also uttered some of his own, full of muchunderstanding and wisdom. When as therefore the first Jesusdied, leaving this book almost perfected, Sirach his sonreceiving it after him left it to his own son Jesus, who, havinggotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into onevolume, and called it Wisdom, intituling it both by his ownname, his father's name, and his grandfather's; alluring thehearer by the very name of Wisdom to have a greater love to thestudy of this book. It containeth therefore wise sayings, darksentences, and parables, and certain particular ancient godlystories of men that pleased God; also his prayer and song;moreover, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and whatplagues he had heaped upon their enemies. This Jesus did imitateSolomon, and was no less famous for wisdom and learning, bothbeing indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	[The	Prologue o	 the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach.]	Whereas many and great things have been delivered unto us by the lawand the prophets, and by others that have followed their steps,for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learningand wisdom; and whereof not only the readers must needs becomeskilful themselves, but also they that desire to learn be ableto profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing:my grandfather Jesus, when he had much given himself to thereading of the law, and the prophets, and other books of ourfathers, and had gotten therein good judgment, was drawn on alsohimself to write something pertaining to learning and wisdom; tothe intent that those which are desirous to learn, and areaddicted to these things, might profit much more in livingaccording to the law. Wherefore let me intreat you to read itwith favour and attention, and to pardon us, wherein we may seemto come short of some words, which we have laboured tointerpret. For the same things uttered in Hebrew, and translatedinto another tongue, have not the same force in them: and notonly these things, but the law itself, and the prophets, and therest of the books, have no small difference, when they arespoken in their own language. For in the eight and thirtiethyear coming into Egypt, when Euergetes was king, and continuingthere some time, I found a book of no small learning: thereforeI thought it most necessary for me to bestow some diligence andtravail to interpret it; using great watchfulness and skill inthat space to bring the book to an end, and set it forth forthem also, which in a strange country are willing to learn,being prepared before in manners to live after the law.

The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	3	And hast delivered me, according to the multitude of theymercies and greatness of thy name, from the teeth of them thatwere ready to devour me, and out of the hands of such as soughtafter my life, and from the manifold afflictions which I had;
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	4	From the choking of fire on every side, and from the midst ofthe fire which I kindled not;
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	5	From the depth of the belly of hell, from an unclean tongue,and from lying words.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	6	By an accusation to the king from an unrighteous tongue mysoul drew near even unto death, my life was near to the hellbeneath.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	7	They compassed me on every side, and there was no man to helpme: I looked for the succour of men, but there was none.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	8	Then thought I upon thy mercy, O Lord, and upon thy acts ofold, how thou deliverest such as wait for thee, and savest themout of the hands of the enemies.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	9	Then lifted I up my supplications from the earth, and prayedfor deliverance from death.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	10	I called upon the Lord, the Father of my Lord, that he wouldnot leave me in the days of my trouble, and in the time of theproud, when there was no help.

The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	15	Even from the flower till the grape was ripe hath my heartdelighted in her: my foot went the right way, from my youth upsought I after her.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	16	I bowed down mine ear a little, and received her, and gatmuch learning.
The Book of Sirach (or Ecclesiasticus)	Sir	51	17	I profited therein, therefore will I ascribe glory unto himthat giveth me wisdom.

The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	1	And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son ofNerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son ofAsadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	2	In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, whattime as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	3	And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing ofJechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears ofall the people that came to hear the book,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	4	And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, andin the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from thelowest unto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylonby the river Sud.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	5	Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	6	They made also a collection of money according to every man'spower:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	7	And they sent it to Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest,the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and toall the people which were found with him at Jerusalem,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	8	At the same time when he received the vessels of the house ofthe Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return theminto the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely,silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jadahad made,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	9	After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried awayJechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mightymen, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and broughtthem unto Babylon.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	10	And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy youburnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare yemanna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	11	And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, andfor the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be uponearth as the days of heaven:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	12	And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, andwe shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king ofBabylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shallserve them many days, and find favour in their sight.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	13	Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinnedagainst the Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lordand his wrath is not turned from us.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	14	And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, tomake confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts andsolemn days.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	15	And ye shall say, To the Lord our God belongethrighteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as it is cometo pass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the inhabitants ofJerusalem,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	16	And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, andto our prophets, and to our fathers:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	17	For we have sinned before the Lord,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	18	And disobeyed him, and have not hearkened unto the voice ofthe Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave usopenly:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	19	Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out ofthe land of Egypt, unto this present day, we have beendisobedient unto the Lord our God, and we have been negligent innot hearing his voice.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	20	Wherefore the evils cleaved unto us, and the curse, which theLord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he broughtour fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land thatfloweth with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	21	Nevertheless we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lordour God, according unto all the words of the prophets, whom hesent unto us:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	1	22	But every man followed the imagination of his own wickedheart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of theLord our God.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	1	Therefore the Lord hath made good his word, which hepronounced against us, and against our judges that judgedIsrael, and against our kings, and against our princes, andagainst the men of Israel and Juda,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	2	To bring upon us great plagues, such as never happened underthe whole heaven, as it came to pass in Jerusalem, according tothe things that were written in the law of Moses;
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	3	That a man should eat the flesh of his own son, and the fleshof his own daughter.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	4	Moreover he hath delivered them to be in subjection to allthe kingdoms that are round about us, to be as a reproach anddesolation among all the people round about, where the Lord hathscattered them.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	5	Thus we were cast down, and not exalted, because we havesinned against the Lord our God, and have not been obedient untohis voice.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	6	To the Lord our God appertaineth righteousness: but unto usand to our fathers open shame, as appeareth this day.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	7	For all these plagues are come upon us, which the Lord hathpronounced against us
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	8	Yet have we not prayed before the Lord, that we might turnevery one from the imaginations of his wicked heart.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	9	Wherefore the Lord watched over us for evil, and the Lordhath brought it upon us: for the Lord is righteous in all hisworks which he hath commanded us.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	10	Yet we have not hearkened unto his voice, to walk in thecommandments of the Lord, that he hath set before us.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	11	And now, O Lord God of Israel, that hast brought thy peopleout of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and high arm, andwith signs, and with wonders, and with great power, and hastgotten thyself a name, as appeareth this day:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	12	O Lord our God, we have sinned, we have done ungodly, we havedealt unrighteously in all thine ordinances.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	13	Let thy wrath turn from us: for we are but a few left amongthe heathen, where thou hast scattered us.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	14	Hear our prayers, O Lord, and our petitions, and deliver usfor thine own sake, and give us favour in the sight of themwhich have led us away:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	15	That all the earth may know that thou art the Lord our God,because Israel and his posterity is called by thy name.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	16	O Lord, look down from thine holy house, and consider us: bowdown thine ear, O Lord, to hear us.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	17	Open thine eyes, and behold; for the dead that are in thegraves, whose souls are taken from their bodies, will give untothe Lord neither praise nor righteousness:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	18	But the soul that is greatly vexed, which goeth stooping andfeeble, and the eyes that fail, and the hungry soul, will givethee praise and righteousness, O Lord.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	19	Therefore we do not make our humble supplication before thee,O Lord our God, for the righteousness of our fathers, and of ourkings.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	20	For thou hast sent out thy wrath and indignation upon us, asthou hast spoken by thy servants the prophets, saying,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	21	Thus saith the Lord, Bow down your shoulders to serve theking of Babylon: so shall ye remain in the land that I gave untoyour fathers.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	22	But if ye will not hear the voice of the Lord, to serve theking of Babylon,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	23	I will cause to cease out of the cites of Judah, and fromwithout Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of joy, thevoice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: and thewhole land shall be desolate of inhabitants.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	24	But we would not hearken unto thy voice, to serve the king ofBabylon: therefore hast thou made good the words that thouspakest by thy servants the prophets, namely, that the bones ofour kings, and the bones of our fathers, should be taken out oftheir place.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	25	And, lo, they are cast out to the heat of the day, and to thefrost of the night, and they died in great miseries by famine,by sword, and by pestilence.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	26	And the house which is called by thy name hast thou laidwaste, as it is to be seen this day, for the wickedness of thehouse of Israel and the house of Juda.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	27	O Lord our God, thou hast dealt with us after all thygoodness, and according to all that great mercy of thine,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	28	As thou spakest by thy servant Moses in the day when thoudidst command him to write the law before the children ofIsrael, saying,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	29	If ye will not hear my voice, surely this very greatmultitude shall be turned into a small number among the nations,where I will scatter them.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	30	For I knew that they would not hear me, because it is astiffnecked people: but in the land of their captivities theyshall remember themselves.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	31	And shall know that I am the Lord their God: for I will givethem an heart, and ears to hear:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	32	And they shall praise me in the land of their captivity, andthink upon my name,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	33	And return from their stiff neck, and from their wickeddeeds: for they shall remember the way of their fathers, whichsinned before the Lord.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	34	And I will bring them again into the land which I promisedwith an oath unto their fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, andthey shall be lords of it: and I will increase them, and theyshall not be diminished.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	2	35	And I will make an everlasting covenant with them to be theirGod, and they shall be my people: and I will no more drive mypeople of Israel out of the land that I have given them.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	1	O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, the soul in anguish thetroubled spirit, crieth unto thee.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	2	Hear, O Lord, and have mercy; ar thou art merciful: and havepity upon us, because we have sinned before thee.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	3	For thou endurest for ever, and we perish utterly.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	4	O Lord Almighty, thou God of Israel, hear now the prayers ofthe dead Israelites, and of their children, which have sinnedbefore thee, and not hearkened unto the voice of thee their God:for the which cause these plagues cleave unto us.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	5	Remember not the iniquities of our forefathers: but thinkupon thy power and thy name now at this time.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	6	For thou art the Lord our God, and thee, O Lord, will wepraise.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	7	And for this cause thou hast put thy fear in our hearts, tothe intent that we should call upon thy name, and praise thee inour captivity: for we have called to mind all the iniquity ofour forefathers, that sinned before thee.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	8	Behold, we are yet this day in our captivity, where thou hastscattered us, for a reproach and a curse, and to be subject topayments, according to all the iniquities of our fathers, whichdeparted from the Lord our God.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	9	Hear, Israel, the commandments of life: give ear tounderstand wisdom.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	10	How happeneth it Israel, that thou art in thine enemies'land, that thou art waxen old in a strange country, that thouart defiled with the dead,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	11	That thou art counted with them that go down into the grave?
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	12	Thou hast forsaken the fountain of wisdom.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	13	For if thou hadst walked in the way of God, thou shouldesthave dwelled in peace for ever.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	14	Learn where is wisdom, where is strength, where isunderstanding; that thou mayest know also where is length ofdays, and life, where is the light of the eyes, and peace.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	15	Who hath found out her place? or who hath come into hertreasures ?
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	16	Where are the princes of the heathen become, and such asruled the beasts upon the earth;
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	17	They that had their pastime with the fowls of the air, andthey that hoarded up silver and gold, wherein men trust, andmade no end of their getting?
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	18	For they that wrought in silver, and were so careful, andwhose works are unsearchable,
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	19	They are vanished and gone down to the grave, and others arecome up in their steads.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	20	Young men have seen light, and dwelt upon the earth: but theway of knowledge have they not known,

The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	23	The Agarenes that seek wisdom upon earth, the merchants ofMeran and of Theman, the authors of fables, and searchers out ofunderstanding; none of these have known the way of wisdom, orremember her paths.

The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	25	Great, and hath none end; high, and unmeasurable.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	26	There were the giants famous from the beginning, that were ofso great stature, and so expert in war.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	27	Those did not the Lord choose, neither gave he the way ofknowledge unto them:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	28	But they were destroyed, because they had no wisdom, andperished through their own foolishness.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	29	Who hath gone up into heaven, and taken her, and brought herdown from the clouds?
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	30	Who hath gone over the sea, and found her, and will bring herfor pure gold?
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	31	No man knoweth her way, nor thinketh of her path.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	32	But he that knoweth all things knoweth her, and hath foundher out with his understanding: he that prepared the earth forevermore hath filled it with fourfooted beasts:
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	33	He that sendeth forth light, and it goeth, calleth it again,and it obeyeth him with fear.
The Book of Baruch	Bar	3	34	The stars shined in their watches, and rejoiced: when hecalleth them, they say, Here we be; and so with cheerfulnessthey shewed light unto him that made them.

The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	3	Her parents also were righteous, and taught their daughteraccording to the law of Moses.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	4	Now Joacim was a great rich man, and had a fair gardenjoining unto his house: and to him resorted the Jews; because hewas more honourable than all others.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	5	The same year were appointed two of the ancients of thepeople to be judges, such as the Lord spake of, that wickednesscame from Babylon from ancient judges, who seemed to govern thepeople.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	6	These kept much at Joacim's house: and all that had any suitsin law came unto them.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	7	Now when the people departed away at noon, Susanna went intoher husband's garden to walk.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	8	And the two elders saw her going in every day, and walking;so that their lust was inflamed toward her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	9	And they perverted their own mind, and turned away theireyes, that they might not look unto heaven, nor remember justjudgments.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	10	And albeit they both were wounded with her love, yet durstnot one shew another his grief.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	11	For they were ashamed to declare their lust, that theydesired to have to do with her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	12	Yet they watched diligently from day to day to see her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	13	And the one said to the other, Let us now go home: for it isdinner time.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	14	So when they were gone out, they parted the one from theother, and turning back again they came to the same place; andafter that they had asked one another the cause, theyacknowledged their lust: then appointed they a time bothtogether, when they might find her alone.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	15	And it fell out, as they watched a fit time, she went in asbefore with two maids only, and she was desirous to wash herselfin the garden: for it was hot.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	16	And there was no body there save the two elders, that had hidthemselves, and watched her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	17	Then she said to her maids, Bring me oil and washing balls,and shut the garden doors, that I may wash me.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	18	And they did as she bade them, and shut the garden doors, andwent out themselves at privy doors to fetch the things that shehad commanded them: but they saw not the elders, because theywere hid.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	19	Now when the maids were gone forth, the two elders rose up,and ran unto her, saying,
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	20	Behold, the garden doors are shut, that no man can see us,and we are in love with thee; therefore consent unto us, and liewith us.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	21	If thou wilt not, we will bear witness against thee, that ayoung man was with thee: and therefore thou didst send away thymaids from thee.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	22	Then Susanna sighed, and said, I am straitened on every side:for if I do this thing, it is death unto me: and if I do it notI cannot escape your hands.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	23	It is better for me to fall into your hands, and not do it,than to sin in the sight of the Lord.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	24	With that Susanna cried with a loud voice: and the two elderscried out against her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	25	Then ran the one, and opened the garden door.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	26	So when the servants of the house heard the cry in thegarden, they rushed in at the privy door, to see what was doneunto her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	27	But when the elders had declared their matter, the servantswere greatly ashamed: for there was never such a report made ofSusanna.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	28	And it came to pass the next day, when the people wereassembled to her husband Joacim, the two elders came also fullof mischievous imagination against Susanna to put her to death;
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	29	And said before the people, Send for Susanna, the daughter ofChelcias, Joacim's wife. And so they sent.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	30	So she came with her father and mother, her children, and allher kindred.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	31	Now Susanna was a very delicate woman, and beauteous tobehold.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	32	And these wicked men commanded to uncover her face, (for shewas covered) that they might be filled with her beauty.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	33	Therefore her friends and all that saw her wept.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	34	Then the two elders stood up in the midst of the people, andlaid their hands upon her head.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	35	And she weeping looked up toward heaven: for her hearttrusted in the Lord.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	36	And the elders said, As we walked in the garden alone, thiswoman came in with two maids, and shut the garden doors, andsent the maids away.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	37	Then a young man, who there was hid, came unto her, and laywith her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	38	Then we that stood in a corner of the garden, seeing thiswickedness, ran unto them.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	39	And when we saw them together, the man we could not hold: forhe was stronger than we, and opened the door, and leaped out.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	40	But having taken this woman, we asked who the young man was,but she would not tell us: these things do we testify.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	41	Then the assembly believed them as those that were the eldersand judges of the people: so they condemned her to death.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	42	Then Susanna cried out with a loud voice, and said, Oeverlasting God, that knowest the secrets, and knowest allthings before they be:
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	43	Thou knowest that they have borne false witness against me,and, behold, I must die; whereas I never did such things asthese men have maliciously invented against me.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	44	And the Lord heard her voice.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	45	Therefore when she was led to be put to death, the Lordraised up the holy spirit of a young youth whose name wasDaniel:
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	46	Who cried with a loud voice, I am clear from the blood ofthis woman.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	47	Then all the people turned them toward him, and said, Whatmean these words that thou hast spoken?
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	48	So he standing in the midst of them said, Are ye such fools,ye sons of Israel, that without examination or knowledge of thetruth ye have condemned a daughter of Israel?
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	49	Return again to the place of judgment: for they have bornefalse witness against her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	50	Wherefore all the people turned again in haste, and theelders said unto him, Come, sit down among us, and shew it us,seeing God hath given thee the honour of an elder.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	51	Then said Daniel unto them, Put these two aside one far fromanother, and I will examine them.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	52	So when they were put asunder one from another, he called oneof them, and said unto him, O thou that art waxen old inwickedness, now thy sins which thou hast committed aforetime arecome to light.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	53	For thou hast pronounced false judgment and hast condemnedthe innocent and hast let the guilty go free; albeit the Lordsaith, The innocent and righteous shalt thou not slay.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	54	Now then, if thou hast seen her, tell me, Under what treesawest thou them companying together? Who answered, Under amastick tree.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	55	And Daniel said, Very well; thou hast lied against thine ownhead; for even now the angel of God hath received the sentenceof God to cut thee in two.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	56	So he put him aside, and commanded to bring the other, andsaid unto him, O thou seed of Chanaan, and not of Juda, beautyhath deceived thee, and lust hath perverted thine heart.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	57	Thus have ye dealt with the daughters of Israel, and they forfear companied with you: but the daughter of Juda would notabide your wickedness.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	58	Now therefore tell me, Under what tree didst thou take themcompanying together? Who answered, Under an holm tree.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	59	Then said Daniel unto him, Well; thou hast also lied againstthine own head: for the angel of God waiteth with the sword tocut thee in two, that he may destroy you.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	60	With that all the assembly cried out with a loud voice, andpraised God, who saveth them that trust in him.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	61	And they arose against the two elders, for Daniel hadconvicted them of false witness by their own mouth:
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	62	And according to the law of Moses they did unto them in suchsort as they maliciously intended to do to their neighbour: andthey put them to death. Thus the innocent blood was saved thesame day.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	63	Therefore Chelcias and his wife praised God for theirdaughter Susanna, with Joacim her husband, and all the kindred,because there was no dishonesty found in her.
The Book of Susanna (in Daniel)	Sus	1	64	From that day forth was Daniel had in great reputation in thesight of the people.

The Prayer of Azariah	PrAzar	24	So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty andnine cubits.
The Prayer of Azariah	PrAzar	25	And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it foundabout the furnace.

The Prayer of Manasseh King of Judah	PrMan	1	O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, andJacob, and of their righteous seed; who hast made heaven andearth, with all the ornament thereof; who hast bound the sea bythe word of thy commandment; who hast shut up the deep, andsealed it by thy terrible and glorious name; whom all men fear,and tremble before thy power; for the majesty of thy glorycannot be borne, and thine angry threatening toward sinners isimportable: but thy merciful promise is unmeasurable andunsearchable; for thou art the most high Lord, of greatcompassion, longsuffering, very merciful, and repentest of theevils of men. Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness hastpromised repentance and forgiveness to them that have sinnedagainst thee: and of thine infinite mercies hast appointedrepentance unto sinners, that they may be saved. Thou therefore,O Lord, that art the God of the just, hast not appointedrepentance to the just, as to Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,which have not sinned against thee; but thou hast appointedrepentance unto me that am a sinner: for I have sinned above thenumber of the sands of the sea. My transgressions, O Lord, aremultiplied: my transgressions are multiplied, and I am notworthy to behold and see the height of heaven for the multitudeof mine iniquities. I am bowed down with many iron bands, that Icannot life up mine head, neither have any release: for I haveprovoked thy wrath, and done evil before thee: I did not thywill, neither kept I thy commandments: I have set upabominations, and have multiplied offences. Now therefore I bowthe knee of mine heart, beseeching thee of grace. I have sinned,O Lord, I have sinned, and I acknowledge mine iniquities:wherefore, I humbly beseech thee, forgive me, O Lord, forgiveme, and destroy me not with mine iniquites. Be not angry with mefor ever, by reserving evil for me; neither condemn me to thelower parts of the earth. For thou art the God, even the God ofthem that repent; and in me thou wilt shew all thy goodness: forthou wilt save me, that am unworthy, according to thy greatmercy. Therefore I will praise thee for ever all the days of mylife: for all the powers of the heavens do praise thee, andthine is the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
